       " 'content': 'In an effort to improve employment and internship opportunities, the Central government has tied up with quick commerce and food delivery firm Swiggy, a statement said on September 7. The ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship and the Bengaluru-based startup launched an initiative to provide skilling and employment opportunities within the company\\'s food delivery and the quick commerce network. The partnership is expected to benefit 2.4 lakh delivery partners and staff of restaurant partners associated with Swiggy. The initiative is likely to provide employment, internship and training opportunities for people in restaurant operations, and various aspects of retail management. Under the Swiggy Skills initiative, its delivery partner platform will be integrated with Skill India Digital Hub (SIDH), providing access to online skill development courses, certifications, and training modules to Swiggy\\'s workforce. Jayant Chaudhary, Union minister of state (independent charge) for skill development and entrepreneurship (MSDE), said, \"Today\\'s partnership showcases how public private partnerships can accelerate and create new avenues for the workforce in the (logistics) sector. There are huge opportunities in this space, and we wish to see more corporates engaging with us.\" Rohit Kapoor, CEO of Swiggy Food Marketplace, said, \"We plan to integrate with MSDE\\'s Skill India Digital Hub (SIDH) across our partners\\' apps, enabling almost 2.4 lakh delivery partners and the staff of our 2 lakh restaurant partners to easily access online skill development courses, offline certifications, and training modules\". \"In Swiggy Instamart operations, we will be able to provide recruitment to 3,000 individuals across the country. We have also planned to provide training and internship to 200 people trained by MSDE, in our quick commerce operations at the senior level,\" Kapoor added. Incognito Mode feature Meanwhile, Swiggy said it has launched an industry-first Incognito Mode feature, allowing users to place orders privately across food and quick commerce. Whether planning a surprise, indulging in a personal treat, or making a discreet purchase, Incognito Mode keeps these orders out of the app\\'s history, eliminating the need to manually delete them.  Available on both Swiggy Food and Instamart, Incognito Mode ensures that users can place orders and keep their selections private. Swiggy stated that the Incognito Mode is also ideal for discreet purchases, such as personal wellness products on Swiggy Instamart, as this feature ensures that such orders remain private, giving users confidence that their choices will not be visible to others. \"As social as our lives are becoming, there are still things we prefer to keep private, and Incognito Mode is designed to address that need,\" Kapoor said. \"Whether you\\'re ordering a meal or making a quick purchase, Incognito Mode ensures your choices remain private. We\\'re excited to offer our users a seamless experience that lets them enjoy Swiggy\\'s diverse offerings with enhanced privacy,\" he added. The feature is currently available to 10 per cent of Swiggy users and will be rolled out to all users in the coming days. The Incognito Mode feature can be activated via a toggle in the user\\'s cart. Once activated, a reminder will appear, confirming that Incognito Mode is on. After the order is delivered, it will remain trackable for three hours, allowing users to manage any post-delivery concerns. After that, the order is discreetly hidden from the order history, ensuring that the purchase remains private. With PTI inputs ',\n",
