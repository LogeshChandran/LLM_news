15,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/dnp-moneycontrol-pro-weekender-12816357.html,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender: Fairy Tale Economics,"Treasuries rallied across the curve, with two-year yields down 11 basis points to 3.64%..Related stories.","Dear Reader, The September issue of the IMFŌĆÖs Finance and Development magazine has an article titled, intriguingly, ŌĆśFairy DustŌĆÖs Economic PossibilitiesŌĆÖ┬Āby Zachary Carter, a scholar with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The reference to fairies comes from Lord KeynesŌĆÖ speech at the inaugural meeting of the World Bank and IMF, at Savannah in the US, in March 1946. Keynes, fresh from a performance of TchaikovskyŌĆÖs ballet ŌĆśSleeping BeautyŌĆÖ, said he hoped the Bretton Woods twins, Master Fund and Miss Bank, would receive three gifts from their fairy godmothers: first, a many-coloured coat ŌĆ£as a perpetual reminder that they belong to the whole worldŌĆØ; second, vitamins for ŌĆ£energy and a fearless spirit, which does not shelve and avoid difficult issues, but welcomes them and is determined to solve themŌĆØ; third, ŌĆ£a spirit of wisdomŌĆ” so that their approach to every problem is absolutely objectiveŌĆØ. Carter writes that Keynes celebrated the co-operation among nations at Bretton Woods as a ŌĆśŌĆÖvictory for the human spiritŌĆÖŌĆÖ. He quotes Keynes, who told the conference that, ŌĆ£We have been learning to work together. ŌĆ”If we can so continue, this nightmare, in which most of us here present have spent too much of our lives, will be over. The brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase.ŌĆØ After the horrors of the Second World War, a longing for the brotherhood of man was inevitable. But the Soviet Union did not sign the Bretton Woods agreement and within a few years, the Korean War had broken out, putting an end to such fond hopes. To be honest, though, Keynes also┬Āwarned the delegates that ŌĆ£there is scarcely any enduringly successful experience yet of an international body which has fulfilled the hopes of its progenitorsŌĆØ. And he went on to say, again referring to the Sleeping Beauty tale, that he hoped ŌĆ£there is no malicious fairy, no Carabosse, whom he has overlooked and forgotten to ask to the party. For if so the curses which that bad fairy will pronounce will, I feel sure, run as follows: ŌĆ£You two brats shall grow up politicians; your every thought and act should have anarri├©re-pens├®e; everything you determine shall not be for its own sake or on its own merits but because of something else.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ Keynes had tasted defeat at the Bretton Woods conference, where all his proposals were shot down by the Americans, who were intent on ensuring US hegemony through the almighty dollar. Indeed, Robert Skidelsky, in his book on Keynes, wrote, ŌĆ£Frederic Vinson, the US Secretary of the Treasury, took it personally. ŌĆśI donŌĆÖt mind being called malicious, but I do mind being called a fairy,ŌĆÖ he growled.ŌĆØ Why bring up Bretton Woods now? The answer perhaps lies inanother article┬Āin this monthŌĆÖs ŌĆśFinance & DevelopmentŌĆÖ magazine, by former British prime minister Gordon Brown. He writes, ŌĆ£Global challenges that require global solutions are ever present, whether a changing climate or rising cyber threats. And just as we are facing these challenges, the three pillars of the postŌĆōCold War era anchoring the global systemŌĆöunipolarity, hyperglobalisation, and neoliberal economicsŌĆöare collapsing around us. These seismic shifts are sowing the seeds of a new wave of populist nationalism exemplified by the ŌĆ£America FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£Russia FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£India FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£China FirstŌĆØ, and often ŌĆ£my country first and onlyŌĆØ movements springing up round the world.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ We have moved a long way from the spirit of the Bretton Woods conference and are back to the beggar-thy-neighbour protectionist policies of the period between the World Wars. But many would question the assumption that the Bretton Woods institutions were anything other than an extension of US power. The IMFŌĆÖs forcing of austerity down the throats of nations in trouble has come in for much criticism. Indeed, as Carter writes, ŌĆ£KeynesŌĆÖs greatest fear for the Fund and the BankŌĆ” was that the ŌĆ£twinsŌĆØ would become instruments of US power rather than truly independent international bodiesŌĆÖŌĆÖ. As US economist Benn Steil shows in his book, ŌĆśThe Battle of Bretton WoodsŌĆÖ, far from being an embodiment of the human spirit, the Bretton Woods conference was full of intrigue, acrimony and rivalry, and it contains a wealth of anecdotes and quotes, some of which have been reproducedhere. For example, Keynes had remarked to British economist Richard Kahn at the Savannah meeting: ŌĆ£The Americans have no idea how to make these institutions into operating international concerns,ŌĆ” ┬Āand in almost every direction their ideas are bad. Yet. they plainly intend to force their own conceptions on the rest of us. The result is that the institutions look like becoming American concerns, run by gigantic American staffs, with the rest of us very much on the side-lines.ŌĆØ In a lecture delivered at the London School of Economics, Paul Bareau, a member of the British Treasury delegation to Washington, asserted that Keynes said, ŌĆ£I went to Savannah to meet the world, and all I met was a tyrant.ŌĆØ And in a letter to the Foreign Office, Keynes said they had to sign the Bretton Woods agreement without reading it because their hosts had made arrangements to throw them out of the hotel. Brotherhood of man, indeed! Keynes also detested Harry Dexter White, the leader of the US team at Bretton Woods and most of the other Americans there. Perhaps most scathing was this remark about Mariner Eccles, the Fed chairman: ŌĆ£No wonder that man is a Mormon. No single woman could stand him.ŌĆØ Nope, Bretton Woods was not about idealism or the spirit of brotherhood. The twin institutions were to be the instruments of US power and the US view was bulldozed through. Paul Bareau said, ŌĆ£We [the British] lost on every issue, not by the process of rational argument in debate but by the solid massing of the cohorts which voted automatically with America, [particularly the Latin Americans,] whose representatives could be depended on to read sometimes with considerable difficulty the speeches prepared for them by the Secretariat of the United States delegation.ŌĆØ The simple fact is that in Bretton Woods, the US prepared the ground to take over BritainŌĆÖs role as the worldŌĆÖs greatest power. US historian John Morton Blum wrote: ŌĆ£Congress was spontaneously more generous towards China than towards England, perhaps because no one envisaged China as a postwar rival for power or commerce.ŌĆØ The wheel has turned full circle and China is now AmericaŌĆÖs bete noire, just as Japan had become in the eighties. Keynes died within a month of the Savannah meeting, at the early age of 62. The irony was that his American rival at Bretton Woods, Harry Dexter White, was later accused of being a Soviet agent. In August 1948, two days after testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he denied being a Communist, he died of a heart attack, aged 55. It is time for soberly facing up to reality, to realise that the world has become a far more dangerous place, to acknowledge that the rules of the game have changed. Instead, the markets are ignoring the increase in risks, preferring to believe in fairy dust. Asthis FT story┬Ātells us, ŌĆ£The medium-term future for globalisation seems set: a struggle between Washington and Beijing for pre-eminence, or at least resilience, which continually threatens to override economic efficiency with national security.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ Gordon Brown, in his Finance and Development article, says ŌĆ£a power-based order is replacing a rules-based orderŌĆÖŌĆÖ.

According to him, the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. As far as top bets are concerned, he remains positive on consumer-related stocks. Additionally, he holds a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals, said the seasoned investment professional with 16 years of extensive experience managing diverse investment portfolios. Do you see interesting opportunities in banks & lenders space? The financial sector has relatively underperformed compared to the broader market, yet recent quarterly results indicate strong earnings growth across most segments, except for public sector banks. Given the sector's strong fundamentals and reasonable valuation levels, there is a distinct possibility of outperformance in the next 12 months. However, slowing credit growth, relatively weak deposit growth, potential asset-liability mismatches, and a likely increase in non-performing assets may temper earnings growth for banks and other financial institutions. Consequently, expecting most of the financial sector may perform in line with the market over the next year. Our outlook is positive on asset management, insurance, and wealth management firms. Is the two-wheeler space looking relatively better compared to commercial and passenger vehicles? Yes, the two-wheeler segment has significantly outperformed the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors in recent months, both in terms of fundamental performance and price appreciation. This trend is expected to continue in the near future, as the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. Your top bets among sectors and why? Despite a mixed performance across consumption-driven sectors in the April-June 2024 quarter results (Source: NSE) â€”with autos and durables showing growth while FMCG and retail underperformedâ€”remaining positive on consumer-related stocks. In contrast, investment-related sectors such as capital goods, construction, real estate, and cement are fundamentally strong but appear to have built-in high expectations in both earnings and valuations. Additionally, holding a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals. Should one keep accumulating pharma space? I have a positive outlook on the healthcare sector. However, given the significant differentiation in business models and product lines within the pharma space, a top-down investment approach is challenging. Do you expect SIP inflow to equity market remain unstoppable? While nothing in life or the stock market is unstoppable, there are compelling reasons to believe that SIP inflows into equity mutual funds in India may continue robustly. First, despite market volatility, SIP inflows have been rising steadily since 2016, indicating that Indian households recognize the value of systematic, long-term equity investment as a wealth creation tool. This growing financial literacy is likely to sustain SIP flows in the coming years. Second, while equity allocations have increased, the proportion of equity-linked instruments in Indian household portfolios remains around 15 percent (Source: RBI), just half the global average. As Indian portfolios align more closely with global norms, expect equity allocations to rise, further boosting SIP inflows. Bank deposits still account for more than double the share of equities in household portfolios. With rising financial awareness, anticipate a continued shift toward equities, which may keep SIP flows strong. ","September 07, 2024/ 06:25 IST"

The S& P 500 dropped 1.7 per cent to close out its worst week since March 2023. Broadcom, Nvidia and other tech companies drove the market lower amid ongoing concerns that their prices soared too high in the boom around artificial intelligence, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down by a market-leading 2.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 410 points, or 1 per cent, after erasing a morning gain of 250 points. Sharp swings also hit the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed US employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. It was billed as the most important jobs report of the year, and it showed a second straight month where hiring came in below forecasts. It also followed recent reports showing weakness in manufacturing and some other areas in the economy. Such a softening of the job market is actually just what the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, have been trying to get in order to stifle high inflation, ""but only to a certain extent and the data is now testing Chair Powell's stated limits,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Friday's data raised questions about how much the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by at its meeting later this month. The Fed is about to turn its focus more toward protecting the job market and preventing a recession after keeping the federal funds rate at a two-decade high for more than a year. Cuts to interest rates can boost investment prices, but the worry on Wall Street is that the Fed may be moving too late. If a recession does hit, it would undercut corporate profits and erase the benefits from lower rates. ""All is not well with the labour market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. ""The Fed wanted the labour market to come into better balance, but any balancing act is unstable."" Still, the jobs report did include some encouraging data points. For one, the unemployment rate improved to 4.2 per cent from 4.3 per cent a month earlier. That was better than economists expected. And even if August's hiring was weaker than forecast, it was still better than July's pace. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's board of governors, said in a speech after the jobs report's release that ""I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data."" ""While the labour market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon,"" he said. While Waller said he thinks a ""series of reductions"" to rates is appropriate given that a slowing job market now looks like the bigger threat for the economy than high inflation, he said the ultimate pace and depth of those cuts is still to be determined. All the uncertainty sent Treasury yields on a wild ride in the bond market as traders tried to handicap the Fed's next moves. The two-year Treasury yield initially fell as low as 3.64 per cent after the release of the jobs report, before quickly climbing back above 3.76 per cent. It then dropped back to 3.66 per cent following Waller's comments, down from 3.74 per cent late Thursday. Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Wren said he was surprised by the size of markets' swings. While data has clearly shown a slowdown in the economy, he's still forecasting growth to continue, ""and it's not the end of the world"". He cautioned investors against panicking and selling their investments in knee-jerk reactions. Despite its dismal week, the S& P 500 remains just 4.6 per cent below its all-time high set in July. It's also still up 13.4 per cent for 2024 so far, which counts as a good year. A big reason for Friday's sharp drops was weakness for some big tech stocks that had been benefiting from the AI boom. Broadcom tumbled 10.4 per cent despite reporting profit and revenue for the latest quarter that were above analysts' forecasts, thanks in part to AI. The chip company said it expects to make $14 billion in revenue this quarter, which was slightly below analysts' expectations of $14.11 billion, according to FactSet. Its stock sank 15.9 per cent for the week. Other chip companies also fell Friday, including a 4.1 per cent drop for Nvidia. After soaring earlier this year as its revenue surged on the AI frenzy, Nvidia's stock has been shaky since mid-July as investors question whether they took it too high. Because of its massive size, Nvidia's stock is one of the most influential on Wall Street, and it fell 13.9 per cent over the week. That's even though Nvidia has continued to top analysts' expectations for growth. On the winning side of Wall Street was US Steel, which rose 4.3 per cent after the CEO of rival Cleveland Cliffs told MSNBC that his company would still be interested in acquiring US Steel if the White House were to block its proposed sale to Japan's Nippon Steel. All told, the S&P 500 fell 94.99 points to 5,408.42. The Dow dropped 410.34 to 40,345.41, and the Nasdaq composite lost 436.83 to 16,690.83. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Trading was halted in Hong Kong because of a typhoon. ","September 07, 2024/ 06:47 IST"

The company has said in the past that they intend to focus on expanding the non-airline business. During the June quarter, the hotels and holiday packages business clocked a gross booking revenue growth of 116% year on year at Rs 210 crore. Since the time of listing in 2013, when 97% of the business was coming from airlines, this number has come down to about 88%, according to Ease My Trip. Over the next couple of years, the company intends to grow the non-air business to 25%, it has said. ","September 06, 2024/ 14:26 IST"

ŌĆ£From trading under a banyan tree, to trading under a click of the button, to trading on a smartphone, Indian markets have come a long way, he said. Chauhan was speaking at the inauguration of the NSE Bull statue in Mumbai on September 6. The NSE Bull shows a relationship of ŌĆ£bazaarŌĆØ and ŌĆ£samajŌĆØ, where the bull is the symbol of capital markets and the people around it showcases the samaj (society), said Chauhan. Thirty years ago, stock markets were not accessible to the ŌĆśSamajŌĆÖ, and with the automated screen-based trading, markets reached all the corners of the country, he said. Throwing some light on the statistics, Chauhan said that NSE has 10 crore unique investors registered with the exchange, with 19 crore trading accounts covering 99.84 percent pincodes in the country. He added that today, only 30 pincodes in India do not have registered investors. Since 1994, the market capitalisation of NSE-listed companies has increased 121 times to $5.5 trillion. He also added that NSE is the largest exchange today in terms of number of orders and number of trades.

Among the main board IPOs, the four firms that will vie for investor attention areBajaj Housing Finance, which will raise around Rs 6,560 crore, Tolins Tyres (Rs 230 crore), Kross Ltd (Rs 500 crore) and P N Gadgil Jewellers (Rs 1,100 crore). Another main board IPO, Western Carriers India, is likely to open soon though the company has yet to disclose a specific timeline for the offering. While Bajaj Housing Finance, Tolins Tyres and Kross Ltd will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11, P N Gadgil Jeweller IPO will open on September 10 and close on September 12.  Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, highlights several factors driving the positive trend in India's primary market. The current market buoyancy is fueled by broad investor participation with retail investors eager to capitalise on attractive listing gains, spurred by the strong performance of the secondary market -- Nifty is up 15.71 percent in the current calendar year till date. Additionally, robust liquidity among both domestic and foreign institutional investors has significantly bolstered the IPO market pipeline. Incidentally, the grey market premiums (GMP) for these firms are also surging. Bajaj Housing Finance GMP is trading at Rs 51 a share, up 73 percent from its upper end price band of Rs 70 a share, Tolins Tyres GMP is trading 12 percent higher while P N Gadgil Jewellers IPO is trading over 37 percent higher. Among SME IPOs, four companies -- Gajanand International, Share Samadhan, Shubhshree Biofuels Energy and Aditya Ultra Steel -- will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11. Two firms -- Trafiksol ITS Technologies, SPP Polymer -- will open on September 10 and close on September 13 while another two -- Innomet Advanced Materials and Excellent Wires & Packaging -- will open on September 11 and close on September 13. These firms will raise between Rs 12-45 crore each through their public issues. The recent past has seen IPOs attracting huge subscriptions. Among main board IPOs in August, the average subscription was over 75 times, while the average for 2024 so far stands at 66 times. For SME IPOs, the average subscription in August reached 290 times, with a year-to-date average of over 259 times. The strong subscription across IPOs has been driven by robust participation from retail, institutional, and foreign investors. Data from NSDL shows that while foreign investors have been net sellers in secondary markets, they have consistently invested in primary markets. In August, FIIs invested around Rs 12,872 crore, and so far in CY24, their investments in primary markets have totalled around Rs54,883 crore. Analysts note that most recent IPO offerings are emerging from high-growth, sunrise sectors, thereby attracting investors anticipating strong growth potential. This trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2024 and may extend into 2025, they say. ŌĆ£With growing retail participation and renewed interest from FIIs, driven largely by evolving global macroeconomic conditions, the market environment seems favorable for several upcoming IPOs to finally make their debut on the bourses. The recent success of multiple listings is likely to generate even greater interest in the next wave of IPOs,ŌĆØ says Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. ","September 06, 2024/ 18:02 IST"

""If the August jobs numbers come lower than market expectations and the unemployment rises higher than market expectations, the Fed may even cut by 50 bp. But, this may not be taken positively by the market. The market may even react negatively factoring in serious growth concerns and even a hard landing scenario for the US economy may start weighing on the market."" Vijayakumar said that the Indian economy continues to do well but the only right now is the elevated valuations. Technical View ""Regarding further downside, 24,800 is a critical support level; if breached, more decline could follow. There's only a potential 200 to 300 points downside expected in the short term,"" said Mehul Kothari toldMoneycontrol.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) will limit the number of options contract expiries to one per exchange a week and nearly triple the minimum trading amount, the sources said, in rules similar to those proposed in July, despite pushback from traders and brokers. But SEBI will review some of its earlier proposals to increase margin requirements and to monitor intraday trading positions, according to the sources. Authorities have been flagging risks from speculative trading by retail investors, who have been funnelling savings into India's booming options market. The monthly notional value of derivatives traded was Rs 10,923 lakh crore ($130.13 trillion) in August - the highest globally, data from the regulator showed. The largest share of trading is in options contracts linked to stock indices like BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50. The share of individual investors in index options has risen to 41% in the financial year ended March 2024 from 2% six years earlier, regulatory data showed. ""A key objective was to put an end to the large and rising speculative volumes in index options contracts close to expiry,"" said the first of the sources, who all declined to be identified as the decisions are not yet public. ""The regulator believes that this warrants additional measures both for small investor protection and for ensuring continued systemic stability,"" the source added. The final rules will be released this month through a circular, the sources said. The details have not been reported previously. SEBI did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The steps follow an increase in tax on derivative transactions in July intended to reduce the participation of retail investors in the options market. India's finance minister flagged concerns in May that any unchecked explosion of retail investor trading in derivatives could create future challenges for the markets, investor sentiment and household finances. SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The regulator received nearly 10,000 comments on its July proposals from traders and other market participants after a social media campaign, the first source said, adding a large majority of them were from traders and brokers who argued the regulator's new rules would hit trading profits and liquidity. ""There was a social media campaign to overwhelm the regulator with the responses,"" the source added. The final rules will ask exchanges to reduce the number of contract expiries to one a week per exchange from multiple expiries currently that give traders the opportunity to speculate more, said the four sources. SEBI will also raise the minimum trading amount to nearly Rs 15-20 lakh ($18,000-$24,000) as proposed in the July consultation paper from Rs 5 lakh, the second of the sources said. In its proposals, the regulator had suggested higher margins for contracts expiring on the same day, but feedback from the country's stock exchanges and market participants said this would be difficult to implement. This was a genuine concern and the regulator would tweak the proposed hike in margins, the sources said. Exchanges and depositories also raised concerns over intraday monitoring of positions in index derivatives due to a lack of technical capability and the regulator might not insist on it for now, the third of the sources said.
