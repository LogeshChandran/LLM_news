From here on, the market may be very volatile around US elections, he feels. Among sectors, Amit, who has over 14 years of experience in the Indian Banking & Financial Services Industry, is bullish on the PSU banks and very few PSUs at today's prices. On the Ola Electric Mobility, he is cautious at current valuations. ""While some brokerages see potential upside, the current high valuation coupled with significant volatility suggests caution for new investors."" Do you see the chances of continuation of major upside in the equity market than major downside in coming months? What are the key triggers? In my last interview on 18th August, 2023 with Money Control I said that Nifty will touch 25,000 which is now a reality. In the last 1 year, Nifty has given 27 percent return which is a fantastic performance by all standards. In the last 1 year, the Indian stock market has outpaced all other global stock markets in the world. However, now after accomplishing our target of Nifty @ 25,000. We are taking a cautious approach for the Nifty and broader market for at least next 6 months. From here on, the market may be very volatile around US elections which may create opportunities for fresh investment for medium to long term investors. Do you see the big flow of IPOs (mainboard) in coming months considering the healthy equity market conditions? With the Nifty 50 and Sensex reaching record highs, the Indian equity markets are poised for a surge in mainboard IPOs in the coming quarters. High-profile companies, such as Bajaj Housing Finance and Hyundai Motor India, are launching their IPOs soon. The successful listing of recent IPOs has demonstrated strong investor appetite. The market's ability to absorb a significant number of IPOs remains to be seen. Are you taking a cautious approach while investing in SME IPOs? Yes, Indeed. Although investors have made a lot of money in the SME IPOs. We hold a cautious view on SME IPOs. Only after thorough analysis, people should make a decision of applying in these SME IPOs. We have been noticing a huge up-trend in them. When allocating the investments of our Global Family Offices, we make sure that the companies that we invest in are always fundamentally strong with an upside on the growth prospect. Which are the sectors on your radar for investment now? As we are expecting a market correction in both the Global and Indian Stock Markets, we have identified particular sectors and even in those sectors we are bullish on very specific stocks. This is because unlike the bull run we have witnessed in the first half of the year is a thing of the past and only very specific stocks will be generating alpha going forward. With the current market situation, I am bullish on the PSU Banks and very few PSUs at today's prices. From the index, I like Bank of Baroda, Bank Of India at current levels. Your take on Bajaj Housing Finance IPO? Bajaj Housing Finance's upcoming IPO presents a compelling opportunity, but it warrants a cautious approach. As a subsidiary of Bajaj Finance, it benefits from a robust brand reputation and strong backing. The company has a solid track record of profitability, low delinquency rates, and a diverse loan portfolio, which enhances its appeal in the growing housing finance sector. However, potential investors should consider risks such as rising interest rates and competitive pricing. The IPO's size of Rs 6,560 crore indicates significant market interest, but careful analysis of its financial health and market conditions is essential to make an informed investment decision. Do you thinkOlais still an overvalued stock? Ola Electric's stock seems overvalued, especially after its recent surge, which has seen it trading at a valuation higher than Tesla. Despite a 107 percent increase from its IPO price, the company's market capitalization reached approximately Rs 55,000 crore, while it reported widening losses of Rs 347 crore in the last quarter. We are cautious on this stock at current valuations. While some brokerages see potential upside, the current high valuation coupled with significant volatility suggests caution for new investors.

However, it is important to view this profit booking as a healthy component in a predominantly upward trend; this allows for a cooling down of elevated valuations and technical parameters, bringing them to a more comfortable level. On the level-specific front, the 25000 mark now seems to be a critical resistance zone, and an authoritative breakthrough could only bring back the positive momentum in the Nifty.

The reference to fairies comes from Lord KeynesŌĆÖ speech at the inaugural meeting of the World Bank and IMF, at Savannah in the US, in March 1946. Keynes, fresh from a performance of TchaikovskyŌĆÖs ballet ŌĆśSleeping BeautyŌĆÖ, said he hoped the Bretton Woods twins, Master Fund and Miss Bank, would receive three gifts from their fairy godmothers: first, a many-coloured coat ŌĆ£as a perpetual reminder that they belong to the whole worldŌĆØ; second, vitamins for ŌĆ£energy and a fearless spirit, which does not shelve and avoid difficult issues, but welcomes them and is determined to solve themŌĆØ; third, ŌĆ£a spirit of wisdomŌĆ” so that their approach to every problem is absolutely objectiveŌĆØ. Carter writes that Keynes celebrated the co-operation among nations at Bretton Woods as a ŌĆśŌĆÖvictory for the human spiritŌĆÖŌĆÖ. He quotes Keynes, who told the conference that, ŌĆ£We have been learning to work together. ŌĆ”If we can so continue, this nightmare, in which most of us here present have spent too much of our lives, will be over. The brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase.ŌĆØ After the horrors of the Second World War, a longing for the brotherhood of man was inevitable. But the Soviet Union did not sign the Bretton Woods agreement and within a few years, the Korean War had broken out, putting an end to such fond hopes. To be honest, though, Keynes also┬Āwarned the delegates that ŌĆ£there is scarcely any enduringly successful experience yet of an international body which has fulfilled the hopes of its progenitorsŌĆØ. And he went on to say, again referring to the Sleeping Beauty tale, that he hoped ŌĆ£there is no malicious fairy, no Carabosse, whom he has overlooked and forgotten to ask to the party. For if so the curses which that bad fairy will pronounce will, I feel sure, run as follows: ŌĆ£You two brats shall grow up politicians; your every thought and act should have anarri├©re-pens├®e; everything you determine shall not be for its own sake or on its own merits but because of something else.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ Keynes had tasted defeat at the Bretton Woods conference, where all his proposals were shot down by the Americans, who were intent on ensuring US hegemony through the almighty dollar. Indeed, Robert Skidelsky, in his book on Keynes, wrote, ŌĆ£Frederic Vinson, the US Secretary of the Treasury, took it personally. ŌĆśI donŌĆÖt mind being called malicious, but I do mind being called a fairy,ŌĆÖ he growled.ŌĆØ Why bring up Bretton Woods now? The answer perhaps lies inanother article┬Āin this monthŌĆÖs ŌĆśFinance & DevelopmentŌĆÖ magazine, by former British prime minister Gordon Brown. He writes, ŌĆ£Global challenges that require global solutions are ever present, whether a changing climate or rising cyber threats. And just as we are facing these challenges, the three pillars of the postŌĆōCold War era anchoring the global systemŌĆöunipolarity, hyperglobalisation, and neoliberal economicsŌĆöare collapsing around us. These seismic shifts are sowing the seeds of a new wave of populist nationalism exemplified by the ŌĆ£America FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£Russia FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£India FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£China FirstŌĆØ, and often ŌĆ£my country first and onlyŌĆØ movements springing up round the world.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ We have moved a long way from the spirit of the Bretton Woods conference and are back to the beggar-thy-neighbour protectionist policies of the period between the World Wars. But many would question the assumption that the Bretton Woods institutions were anything other than an extension of US power. The IMFŌĆÖs forcing of austerity down the throats of nations in trouble has come in for much criticism. Indeed, as Carter writes, ŌĆ£KeynesŌĆÖs greatest fear for the Fund and the BankŌĆ” was that the ŌĆ£twinsŌĆØ would become instruments of US power rather than truly independent international bodiesŌĆÖŌĆÖ. As US economist Benn Steil shows in his book, ŌĆśThe Battle of Bretton WoodsŌĆÖ, far from being an embodiment of the human spirit, the Bretton Woods conference was full of intrigue, acrimony and rivalry, and it contains a wealth of anecdotes and quotes, some of which have been reproducedhere. For example, Keynes had remarked to British economist Richard Kahn at the Savannah meeting: ŌĆ£The Americans have no idea how to make these institutions into operating international concerns,ŌĆ” ┬Āand in almost every direction their ideas are bad. Yet. they plainly intend to force their own conceptions on the rest of us. The result is that the institutions look like becoming American concerns, run by gigantic American staffs, with the rest of us very much on the side-lines.ŌĆØ In a lecture delivered at the London School of Economics, Paul Bareau, a member of the British Treasury delegation to Washington, asserted that Keynes said, ŌĆ£I went to Savannah to meet the world, and all I met was a tyrant.ŌĆØ And in a letter to the Foreign Office, Keynes said they had to sign the Bretton Woods agreement without reading it because their hosts had made arrangements to throw them out of the hotel. Brotherhood of man, indeed! Keynes also detested Harry Dexter White, the leader of the US team at Bretton Woods and most of the other Americans there. Perhaps most scathing was this remark about Mariner Eccles, the Fed chairman: ŌĆ£No wonder that man is a Mormon. No single woman could stand him.ŌĆØ Nope, Bretton Woods was not about idealism or the spirit of brotherhood. The twin institutions were to be the instruments of US power and the US view was bulldozed through. Paul Bareau said, ŌĆ£We [the British] lost on every issue, not by the process of rational argument in debate but by the solid massing of the cohorts which voted automatically with America, [particularly the Latin Americans,] whose representatives could be depended on to read sometimes with considerable difficulty the speeches prepared for them by the Secretariat of the United States delegation.ŌĆØ The simple fact is that in Bretton Woods, the US prepared the ground to take over BritainŌĆÖs role as the worldŌĆÖs greatest power. US historian John Morton Blum wrote: ŌĆ£Congress was spontaneously more generous towards China than towards England, perhaps because no one envisaged China as a postwar rival for power or commerce.ŌĆØ The wheel has turned full circle and China is now AmericaŌĆÖs bete noire, just as Japan had become in the eighties. Keynes died within a month of the Savannah meeting, at the early age of 62. The irony was that his American rival at Bretton Woods, Harry Dexter White, was later accused of being a Soviet agent. In August 1948, two days after testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he denied being a Communist, he died of a heart attack, aged 55. It is time for soberly facing up to reality, to realise that the world has become a far more dangerous place, to acknowledge that the rules of the game have changed. Instead, the markets are ignoring the increase in risks, preferring to believe in fairy dust. Asthis FT story┬Ātells us, ŌĆ£The medium-term future for globalisation seems set: a struggle between Washington and Beijing for pre-eminence, or at least resilience, which continually threatens to override economic efficiency with national security.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ Gordon Brown, in his Finance and Development article, says ŌĆ£a power-based order is replacing a rules-based orderŌĆÖŌĆÖ. This is not a time for fairy tales.

That level of gyration drove its 30-day realized volatility up to about 80 â€” roughly four times the level of Microsoft Corp., double Bitcoinâ€™s figure and higher than meme stocks like Donald Trumpâ€™s media company and Elon Muskâ€™s Tesla Inc..Related stories.","Nvidia Corp. wiped out about $406 billion in value this week, weighing on key equity benchmarks as jitters spread over the health of the US economy and an AI trade that may have gotten ahead of itself. The worldâ€™s largest artificial-intelligence chipmaker shed a fifth of its value over the past two weeks. The declines also showcase a more pressing issue for investors in the $2.5 trillion giant: Its volatility now dwarfs its Magnificent Seven peers and makes Bitcoin look like a port of calm. Nvidia shares have swung between $90.69 and $131.26 over the past 30 trading days, with a record amount of market value being wiped out Tuesday. That level of gyration drove its 30-day realized volatility up to about 80 â€” roughly four times the level of Microsoft Corp., double Bitcoinâ€™s figure and higher than meme stocks like Donald Trumpâ€™s media company and Elon Muskâ€™s Tesla Inc.  The stumble has pushed the stock to its worst two-week stretch in two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The declines came after a tepid forecast and issues for its Blackwell chip, which dented investor euphoria. Then came news that the US Justice Department sent subpoenas in an escalating antitrust probe. Adding to the gloom for chipmakers broadly, Broadcom Inc. released a disappointing sales forecast. â€śYouâ€™re just in a very difficult market environment right this second,â€ť said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management LLC, adding that the AI trade is still in its early days. Still, â€śon a day-to-day basis, where the bottom is, is anybodyâ€™s guess.â€ť Rewarding Year Of course, the stock has rewarded investors handsomely this year, even with the recent slide. The shares are still up more than 100% this year, adding $1.3 trillion in market value. And Wall Street roundly expects that Nvidia remains well positioned as companies build out infrastructure related to AI, a process thatâ€™s expected to last for several more quarters at least. Nvidiaâ€™s biggest customers â€” notably Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which together comprise more than 40% of Nvidiaâ€™s revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show â€” affirmed their spending plans in their most recent quarters. Nvidiaâ€™s results last week confirmed this rosy view. Revenue more than doubled and came in better than expected, as did adjusted earnings. The company also gave a revenue forecast that beat the analyst consensus, though it failed to meet the high end of estimates.  That result underwhelmed market participants who had grown accustomed to blowout reports. It also fed into concerns for those who are skeptical about the long-term outlook for spending on AI. It all means that as investors digest the evolution of the AI theme, the volatility in shares of Nvidia and other chipmakers will likely persist. For money managers who want to get in for the long haul, that could spell opportunity. â€śFor a long-term investor, this is a good time to start picking away,â€ť said Williams at Wayve Capital. â€śIf somebody handed me new money today, I would be enthusiastically adding some AI-related stocks.â€ť ",2024-09-07 06:58

The S& P 500 dropped 1.7 per cent to close out its worst week since March 2023. Broadcom, Nvidia and other tech companies drove the market lower amid ongoing concerns that their prices soared too high in the boom around artificial intelligence, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down by a market-leading 2.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 410 points, or 1 per cent, after erasing a morning gain of 250 points. Sharp swings also hit the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed US employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. It was billed as the most important jobs report of the year, and it showed a second straight month where hiring came in below forecasts. It also followed recent reports showing weakness in manufacturing and some other areas in the economy. Such a softening of the job market is actually just what the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, have been trying to get in order to stifle high inflation, ""but only to a certain extent and the data is now testing Chair Powell's stated limits,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Friday's data raised questions about how much the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by at its meeting later this month. The Fed is about to turn its focus more toward protecting the job market and preventing a recession after keeping the federal funds rate at a two-decade high for more than a year. Cuts to interest rates can boost investment prices, but the worry on Wall Street is that the Fed may be moving too late. If a recession does hit, it would undercut corporate profits and erase the benefits from lower rates. ""All is not well with the labour market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. ""The Fed wanted the labour market to come into better balance, but any balancing act is unstable."" Still, the jobs report did include some encouraging data points. For one, the unemployment rate improved to 4.2 per cent from 4.3 per cent a month earlier. That was better than economists expected. And even if August's hiring was weaker than forecast, it was still better than July's pace. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's board of governors, said in a speech after the jobs report's release that ""I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data."" ""While the labour market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon,"" he said. While Waller said he thinks a ""series of reductions"" to rates is appropriate given that a slowing job market now looks like the bigger threat for the economy than high inflation, he said the ultimate pace and depth of those cuts is still to be determined. All the uncertainty sent Treasury yields on a wild ride in the bond market as traders tried to handicap the Fed's next moves. The two-year Treasury yield initially fell as low as 3.64 per cent after the release of the jobs report, before quickly climbing back above 3.76 per cent. It then dropped back to 3.66 per cent following Waller's comments, down from 3.74 per cent late Thursday. Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Wren said he was surprised by the size of markets' swings. While data has clearly shown a slowdown in the economy, he's still forecasting growth to continue, ""and it's not the end of the world"". He cautioned investors against panicking and selling their investments in knee-jerk reactions. Despite its dismal week, the S& P 500 remains just 4.6 per cent below its all-time high set in July. It's also still up 13.4 per cent for 2024 so far, which counts as a good year. A big reason for Friday's sharp drops was weakness for some big tech stocks that had been benefiting from the AI boom. Broadcom tumbled 10.4 per cent despite reporting profit and revenue for the latest quarter that were above analysts' forecasts, thanks in part to AI. The chip company said it expects to make $14 billion in revenue this quarter, which was slightly below analysts' expectations of $14.11 billion, according to FactSet. Its stock sank 15.9 per cent for the week. Other chip companies also fell Friday, including a 4.1 per cent drop for Nvidia. After soaring earlier this year as its revenue surged on the AI frenzy, Nvidia's stock has been shaky since mid-July as investors question whether they took it too high. Because of its massive size, Nvidia's stock is one of the most influential on Wall Street, and it fell 13.9 per cent over the week. That's even though Nvidia has continued to top analysts' expectations for growth. On the winning side of Wall Street was US Steel, which rose 4.3 per cent after the CEO of rival Cleveland Cliffs told MSNBC that his company would still be interested in acquiring US Steel if the White House were to block its proposed sale to Japan's Nippon Steel. All told, the S&P 500 fell 94.99 points to 5,408.42. The Dow dropped 410.34 to 40,345.41, and the Nasdaq composite lost 436.83 to 16,690.83. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Trading was halted in Hong Kong because of a typhoon. ",2024-09-07 06:47

According to him, the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. As far as top bets are concerned, he remains positive on consumer-related stocks. Additionally, he holds a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals, said the seasoned investment professional with 16 years of extensive experience managing diverse investment portfolios. Do you see interesting opportunities in banks & lenders space? The financial sector has relatively underperformed compared to the broader market, yet recent quarterly results indicate strong earnings growth across most segments, except for public sector banks. Given the sector's strong fundamentals and reasonable valuation levels, there is a distinct possibility of outperformance in the next 12 months. However, slowing credit growth, relatively weak deposit growth, potential asset-liability mismatches, and a likely increase in non-performing assets may temper earnings growth for banks and other financial institutions. Consequently, expecting most of the financial sector may perform in line with the market over the next year. Our outlook is positive on asset management, insurance, and wealth management firms. Is the two-wheeler space looking relatively better compared to commercial and passenger vehicles? Yes, the two-wheeler segment has significantly outperformed the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors in recent months, both in terms of fundamental performance and price appreciation. This trend is expected to continue in the near future, as the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. Your top bets among sectors and why? Despite a mixed performance across consumption-driven sectors in the April-June 2024 quarter results (Source: NSE) â€”with autos and durables showing growth while FMCG and retail underperformedâ€”remaining positive on consumer-related stocks. In contrast, investment-related sectors such as capital goods, construction, real estate, and cement are fundamentally strong but appear to have built-in high expectations in both earnings and valuations. Additionally, holding a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals. Should one keep accumulating pharma space? I have a positive outlook on the healthcare sector. However, given the significant differentiation in business models and product lines within the pharma space, a top-down investment approach is challenging. Do you expect SIP inflow to equity market remain unstoppable? While nothing in life or the stock market is unstoppable, there are compelling reasons to believe that SIP inflows into equity mutual funds in India may continue robustly. First, despite market volatility, SIP inflows have been rising steadily since 2016, indicating that Indian households recognize the value of systematic, long-term equity investment as a wealth creation tool. This growing financial literacy is likely to sustain SIP flows in the coming years. Second, while equity allocations have increased, the proportion of equity-linked instruments in Indian household portfolios remains around 15 percent (Source: RBI), just half the global average. As Indian portfolios align more closely with global norms, expect equity allocations to rise, further boosting SIP inflows. Bank deposits still account for more than double the share of equities in household portfolios. With rising financial awareness, anticipate a continued shift toward equities, which may keep SIP flows strong. ",2024-09-07 06:25

The insurer plans to build out its partnership with Shriram Capital Group in the South Asian nation by adding an equal joint venture covering wealth and advice services, doubling down on an initial 2005 investment that has already delivered results in the credit and insurance spaces. â€śA large number of people are breaking out of the real poverty trap, so theyâ€™re able to start focusing on providing for the future,â€ť Sanlam Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanratty said in an interview Thursday. â€śIndia is really at that point where a huge chunk of the population are now able to save and invest for the future.â€ť The International Monetary Fund expects Indiaâ€™s $3.9 trillion economy to expand 6.8% this year. That compares with a forecast for 0.9% growth for South Africa, Sanlamâ€™s home market. The South Asian nation is expected to generate $730 billion of wealth through 2028, according toÂ Boston Consulting Group, and thatâ€™s enticing firms including HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc to expand. State Bank of India, which has more than 22,500 branches in the country, is deploying 2,000 bankers toÂ woo the rich. Blackrock Inc., the worldâ€™s biggest fund manager, in April signed an equal joint venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambaniâ€™s Jio Financial Services Ltd. to set up a wealth-management business and also form a brokerage company in India. The two entities formed a joint venture to set up an Indian asset-management business in July 2023. â€śThatâ€™s a very hot area in India â€” everybodyâ€™s trying to get into it and we are very well positioned to start up,â€ť Hanratty said. â€śWeâ€™ve got a huge distribution footprint, so weâ€™ve just got to get the business and the proposition right, and then just gradually start growing it into our existing basis of branches and customers.â€ť For the six months ended June 30, Sanlamâ€™s India business generated about 16% of profit, up from 10% in 2021. The insurer said headline earnings climbed 43% in the period from a year earlier, buoyed by gains in life and health insurance, a surge in general insurance, and a recovery in investment management. The so-called net result from financial services â€” the companyâ€™s preferred profit measure â€” rose 19% per share. â€śThe operating environment has been a little bit better in the first half of 2024,â€ť Hanratty said, citing the successful conclusion of South Africaâ€™s elections in May, where the inability to produce an outright winner saw the African National Congress â€” which has ruled the country since 1994 â€” establish a multiparty government with nine other entities. AÂ turnaroundÂ at general-insurance unit Santam Ltd., and a strong performance in its African operations that include a joint venture with Germanyâ€™s Allianz SE, also boosted earnings.â€ť Sanlam took a 910 million-rand impairment on AfroCentric Investment Corp., a South African health-administration company in which it holds a majority stake.

Among the main board IPOs, the four firms that will vie for investor attention areBajaj Housing Finance, which will raise around Rs 6,560 crore, Tolins Tyres (Rs 230 crore), Kross Ltd (Rs 500 crore) and P N Gadgil Jewellers (Rs 1,100 crore). Another main board IPO, Western Carriers India, is likely to open soon though the company has yet to disclose a specific timeline for the offering. While Bajaj Housing Finance, Tolins Tyres and Kross Ltd will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11, P N Gadgil Jeweller IPO will open on September 10 and close on September 12.  Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives and Research at SAMCO Securities, highlights several factors driving the positive trend in India's primary market. The current market buoyancy is fueled by broad investor participation with retail investors eager to capitalise on attractive listing gains, spurred by the strong performance of the secondary market -- Nifty is up 15.71 percent in the current calendar year till date. Additionally, robust liquidity among both domestic and foreign institutional investors has significantly bolstered the IPO market pipeline. Incidentally, the grey market premiums (GMP) for these firms are also surging. Bajaj Housing Finance GMP is trading at Rs 51 a share, up 73 percent from its upper end price band of Rs 70 a share, Tolins Tyres GMP is trading 12 percent higher while P N Gadgil Jewellers IPO is trading over 37 percent higher. Among SME IPOs, four companies -- Gajanand International, Share Samadhan, Shubhshree Biofuels Energy and Aditya Ultra Steel -- will open for subscription on September 9 and close on September 11. Two firms -- Trafiksol ITS Technologies, SPP Polymer -- will open on September 10 and close on September 13 while another two -- Innomet Advanced Materials and Excellent Wires & Packaging -- will open on September 11 and close on September 13. These firms will raise between Rs 12-45 crore each through their public issues. The recent past has seen IPOs attracting huge subscriptions. Among main board IPOs in August, the average subscription was over 75 times, while the average for 2024 so far stands at 66 times. For SME IPOs, the average subscription in August reached 290 times, with a year-to-date average of over 259 times. The strong subscription across IPOs has been driven by robust participation from retail, institutional, and foreign investors. Data from NSDL shows that while foreign investors have been net sellers in secondary markets, they have consistently invested in primary markets. In August, FIIs invested around Rs 12,872 crore, and so far in CY24, their investments in primary markets have totalled around Rs54,883 crore. Analysts note that most recent IPO offerings are emerging from high-growth, sunrise sectors, thereby attracting investors anticipating strong growth potential. This trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2024 and may extend into 2025, they say. â€śWith growing retail participation and renewed interest from FIIs, driven largely by evolving global macroeconomic conditions, the market environment seems favorable for several upcoming IPOs to finally make their debut on the bourses. The recent success of multiple listings is likely to generate even greater interest in the next wave of IPOs,â€ť says Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom. ",2024-09-06 18:02

It closed in the red down ~280 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty on account of the fall has reached the crucial support zone 24850 â€“ 24800 which coincides with the 20-day moving average and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. We expect the Nifty to hold on to this support zone and hence shall continue to maintain our short-term positive stance on the Nifty. The immediate hurdle is placed at 25000. The Banking sector led the fall in todayâ€™s trading session. It has decisively closed below the short-term averages and the daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal. Thus, pullback is likely to get sold into. In terms of levels, 50800 â€“ 50949 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone while 50000 â€“ 49700 is the crucial support zone from short term perspective.

The sell-off was broad-based, with the banking and energy sectors taking the biggest hit. Broader indices also saw declines, losing more than a percent each. The recent weakness in US markets has stalled the momentum in Indian markets, causing participants to become cautious ahead of the upcoming jobs data. With the Nifty slipping below the crucial 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA), further downside is likely, with key support around 24,500 at the 50 DEMA.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. This week saw the backlash of stock prices of two mega companies on the US bourses. One, the chip maker Nvidia, whose shares plunged by about 9.5 percent on Tuesday wiping out about $300 billion in a single day! Two, in a completely different industry segment, US Steel shares too tanked 25 percent, with trading briefly halted after news reports alleging that its $14.1 billion deal with Japan's Nippon Steel may be at risk. These are two of the most recent and glaring examples where mere whispers in investor circles -- not confirmed at times -- are sufficient to erase a lifetime of gains made in equity markets. There are numerous such instances in equity markets across countries, developed and emerging, where stock prices have crashed leaving investors in financial distress. And it is not always stock-specific debacles that investors have witnessed. At times, there is a market rout that put investors in a quandary (Japanese Yen carry trade, Middle-East conflict). In this context, it is perhaps time for a reality check in Indian equities, given the unabated rally. Driven by liquidity and unfettered by rising valuations, the Nifty 50 is holding up beyond 25,000 and the BSE Sensex above 82,000. Valuations are not reasonable. On the contrary, the price-to-earnings multiples are at a slight premium to the 10-year averages across segments -- large-cap, mid-cap and small-caps. This article highlights thatÂall is not well in mid-caps.Â â€śA significant portion of the rally in mid-caps can be attributed to the substantial inflows of mid-cap, small-cap, and sectoral/thematic funds,â€ť it states. Besides, recent macroeconomic data have not been flattering. Q1 FY2025 gross domestic growth (GDP) faltered, so did the Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index for August, which slowed. At a micro level, the earnings growth for the quarter moderated on the back of a revenue slowdown. Several sectors such as auto, cement and conspicuous goods consumption portray moderation in growth. Indeed, the silver lining is softening inflation which is raising hopes of an interest rate cut sooner than later. For investors, the dilemma would be whether to opt for a paltry 6-7 percent return from secure fixed income or continue riding the bullish sentiment in equity markets till it lasts.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) will limit the number of options contract expiries to one per exchange a week and nearly triple the minimum trading amount, the sources said, in rules similar to those proposed in July, despite pushback from traders and brokers. But SEBI will review some of its earlier proposals to increase margin requirements and to monitor intraday trading positions, according to the sources. Authorities have been flagging risks from speculative trading by retail investors, who have been funnelling savings into India's booming options market. The monthly notional value of derivatives traded was Rs 10,923 lakh crore ($130.13 trillion) in August - the highest globally, data from the regulator showed. The largest share of trading is in options contracts linked to stock indices like BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50. The share of individual investors in index options has risen to 41% in the financial year ended March 2024 from 2% six years earlier, regulatory data showed. ""A key objective was to put an end to the large and rising speculative volumes in index options contracts close to expiry,"" said the first of the sources, who all declined to be identified as the decisions are not yet public. ""The regulator believes that this warrants additional measures both for small investor protection and for ensuring continued systemic stability,"" the source added. The final rules will be released this month through a circular, the sources said. The details have not been reported previously. SEBI did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The steps follow an increase in tax on derivative transactions in July intended to reduce the participation of retail investors in the options market. India's finance minister flagged concerns in May that any unchecked explosion of retail investor trading in derivatives could create future challenges for the markets, investor sentiment and household finances. SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN The regulator received nearly 10,000 comments on its July proposals from traders and other market participants after a social media campaign, the first source said, adding a large majority of them were from traders and brokers who argued the regulator's new rules would hit trading profits and liquidity. ""There was a social media campaign to overwhelm the regulator with the responses,"" the source added. The final rules will ask exchanges to reduce the number of contract expiries to one a week per exchange from multiple expiries currently that give traders the opportunity to speculate more, said the four sources. SEBI will also raise the minimum trading amount to nearly Rs 15-20 lakh ($18,000-$24,000) as proposed in the July consultation paper from Rs 5 lakh, the second of the sources said. In its proposals, the regulator had suggested higher margins for contracts expiring on the same day, but feedback from the country's stock exchanges and market participants said this would be difficult to implement. This was a genuine concern and the regulator would tweak the proposed hike in margins, the sources said. Exchanges and depositories also raised concerns over intraday monitoring of positions in index derivatives due to a lack of technical capability and the regulator might not insist on it for now, the third of the sources said.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is set to meet in Delhi on September 9 to discuss the implementation of the newly introduced Section 11A in the GST Act, 2017, Moneycontrol reported on September 6. The meeting will focus on interpreting the amendment of the section in a bid to grant relief to demand for retrospective tax. It will have implications for the real-money gaming (RMG) â€” online games where players can wager and win real money â€” industry and other sectors, an official said. Delta Corp owns Adda52, which offers online games like poker and rummy. At 11:55 am on September 6, Delta Corp's shares were trading 4.6 percent higher at Rs 137.52 apiece. The real money gaming (RMG) sub-segment constitutes a substantial part of the online gaming ecosystem, comprising 82.8 percent of the market share in FY23, with more than 400 RMG start-ups6. Industry estimates this sub-segment to contribute around Rs 6,500 crore-Rs 6,800 crore as direct tax revenues (comprising TDS and corporate tax), and Rs 75,000-Rs 76,000 crore as indirect tax revenue (GST) to the exchequer during FY24âˆ’28E, said an EY report in December 2023. In its 53rd meeting held in June, the council had recommended the insertion of Section 11A to regularise non-levy or short-levy of GST. Section 11A seeks to provide a legal safeguard against punitive retrospective tax demand and potentially alleviate financial burdens on industries facing outstanding GST dues. The councilâ€™s decision may have major implications for the RMG sector, which has been grappling with significant GST retrospective tax demand pertaining to a period between July 1 , 2017 â€” the day GST was rolled out â€” and March 31, 2023. Last December, the finance ministry had said that 71 show cause notices were issued to online gaming companies for their alleged GST evasion worth over Rs 1.12 lakh crore. ",2024-09-06 12:13

""We would await more convincing data before turning decisively positive on the sector."" According to him, valuations have already moved up and now Nifty IT is trading at +2standard deviation above mean levels leaving little room for further appreciation. The Nifty IT rallied more than 35 percent since June lows. In case of FMCG space, HDFC Securities has become constructive on the sector and increased allocation in HSIE model portfolio, said Sharma who has over 20 years of experience in the capital markets. What is your earnings forecast for Q2FY25 after reading Q1FY25 numbers? Earnings growth for our coverage universe of 229 stocks got benefited by low input costs and hence far outperformed revenue growth in FY24. In our view, the advantages of soft input costs have largely been consumed and hereon earnings growth must be demand led. So, earnings growth is expected to be closer to revenue growth in FY25, as base effect also catches up. Signs of the earnings growth moderation was visible in Q1FY25 itself when we witnessed 0 percent YoY earnings growth for coverage universe (ex-OMCs, 13 percent YoY growth). It contrasted with 20 percent and 22 percent YoY growth in Q3FY24 and Q4FY24, respectively. We believe YoY earnings growth for Q2FY25 will be in high single digits and for FY25E, it is expected to be 6 percent (ex-energy 13 percent). Have you increased exposure to FMCG and IT space? FMCG FMCG stocks have undergone a moderation in valuations in last couple of years before a recent pickup. Further, there have been a gradual volume growth recovery, which makes us have a close relook at the sector. We expect consumption demand to witness a slight pickup in FY25 driven by normal monsoon, gradual rural recovery, and transmission of input cost benefits to consumers by FMCG companies. Hence, we have become constructive on the sector and increased allocation, as reflected in HSIE model portfolio. IT Led by BFSI clients, green shoots are visible in the demand environment for IT services sector but macro uncertainty and subdued discretionary spendings continue. Furthermore, deal conversions to revenue transmission has improved marginally which reflects early signs of recovery. In view of the short-term uncertainty but bright long-term prospects for the sector, we have built in a gradual recovery in next two years. While sector is awaiting a convincing growth environment, valuations have already moved up and now Nifty IT is trading at +2 standard deviation above mean levels leaving little room for further appreciation. Hence, we continue to be underweight on the sector. We would await more convincing data before turning decisively positive on the sector. Are you considering fresh entry into defence and railway stocks? We donâ€™t have any coverage on defence/railway stocks, nonetheless we have keenly tracked valuations of stocks in these sectors. In our view, the defence and railway themes are potent, and these will continue fueling earnings growth of the involved companies for several more quarters, however many stocks have run ahead of their fundamentals meaningfully. Hence, we wouldnâ€™t recommend a fresh entry until valuation softens to more palatable levels. Do you see better opportunities in new IPOs? In our view, investors are able to identify the nuances to attribute high PEs to profitability and sustainability of delivery. We think the best way to look at IPO situations is on a case-by-case basis; the individual business models are different and so are the markets and customers they service. Itâ€™s not prudent to club them together because the key drivers for these companies especially mortality are different. We take a bottom-up approach to evaluating these companies and focus on the sustainability of their respective business models. Itâ€™s important to have a degree of embedded scrutiny when looking at these new-age tech companies in order to evaluate which of them will have successfully disrupted and changed their industries in the next decade. Your take on consumer staples? Consumer staples segment has been witnessing gradual demand growth revival led by summer portfolio and varied degrees of rural recovery observed by the companies. Hot beverages and refreshment portfolios which remained subdued due to heatwaves in Q1FY25 are expected to show decent growth as summer recedes. Further, normal monsoon and moderate inflation bodes well for rural consumption. Additionally, soft input costs regime has continued which has helped staple companies invest towards A&P and pass on benefits to consumers. In view of all these factors supporting the segment, we have turned constructive on the sector. It can be noted that given our positive view on the sector, we have been reducing our extent of being underweight on the sector in last two quarters and now we have turned marginally overweight, as reflected in the HSIE model portfolio. Do you think Fed may not be aggressive in interest rate cuts, and the RBI may go for one rate cut in 2024? The market is building in a rate cut - also confirmed by recent comments by the Fed Chairperson in recent Jackson Hole Summit. The question is whatâ€™s the quantum? Based on bond market, 30 percent of the market thinks we can get a 50-bps rate cut in September FOMC meet while the majority thinks it is going to be 25bps. Economic data on growth and inflation in the US put us in the second camp. Further, if we consider FEDâ€™s stance for CY24, we expect Fed to cut rate 2-3 times (50-75 bps in total) by December-end. Accordingly, RBI is expected to take a cue from this and begin rate cut cycle with a 25bps cut in CY24. ",2024-09-06 09:13

Brokerages have a divided view on the stock, with Motilal Oswal and JM Financial reiterating their 'buy' ratings, while Nuvama maintained its 'sell on rise' recommendation.

The brokerage maintained a 'buy' rating on Coal India with an unchanged target price of Rs 601. Nuvama emphasised that the globe is not yet prepared to transition to renewable energy. So for the foreseeable future, coal will continue to be the most popular fuel. Additionally, as a result of the disruption in Russia's natural gas supply, demand has switched to coal.

Why itâ€™s important:Annual air passenger traffic is expected to grow from 376 million to 3-3.5 billion by 2047, out of which 10-12 percent may be international traffic. The under-penetration of air travel, rising income levels and improving connectivity to new destinations will be key growth drivers for the industry. #7. FMCG companies pin hopes on rising rural demand to spur sales this summerÂ Consumer goods firms are launching low-unit packs and stepping up distribution and stocking of grocery stores in the countryside as they shift attention back to rural India, the Economic Times reported, citing industry executives. This is in sharp contrast to the past two years, when FMCGs like ITC, Dabur, Marico, Britannia, Parle Products, Emami and Hindustan Unilever focused on premiumization. Why itâ€™s important:Besides expectations of a good monsoon season that will bolster farm incomes, FMCG companies are expecting policy measures in thebudgetto strengthen the revival of demand in rural India. #8. Top 100 property developers see 70 percent leap in valuation in just one year The cumulative valuation of the top 100 real estate companies in India rose by 70 percent in the 12 months ending May, the Business Standard reported. According to the 2024 GROHE-Hurun India Real Estate 100 report, 86 of these companies saw an increase in value, contributing a total of Rs 6.2 lakh crore. The total valuation of the top 100 realty firms in India currently stands at Rs 14.2 lakh crore. Why itâ€™s important:After some years of sluggish growth, Indiaâ€™s real estate sector is outpacing China in the rate of expansion. This is also seen in the strong performance of the S&P BSE Realty Index, which expanded by 110 per cent in he past 12 months. #9. Anomalous job surge during the pandemic throws curve ball to economistsÂ India is estimated to have created 108.9 million jobs between financial years 2019-20 and 2023-24, significantly higher than the 76.8 million jobs added between 2005-06 and 2029-20, the Mint reported, citing provisional data released by the Reserve Bank. In 2023-24 alone, India is estimated to have added 46.7 million jobs. Why itâ€™s important:The dataset on jobs has thrown a curveball at economists tracking Indiaâ€™s economy, baffling many on how the country managed to add a large number of jobs over the past few years despite the Covid-19 shock. #10. Hybrid carmakers in tizzy after slowing June sales and sops by Uttar PradeshÂ Uttar Pradeshâ€™s decision to provide incentives for hybrid vehicles has puzzled electric vehicle manufacturers, especially as it comes on the heels of a plunge in June sales, the Economic Times reported. It has also divided the industry, pitting those betting on pure electrics such as Tata Motors against those that prefer the hybrid route like Toyota and Maruti Suzuki. Why itâ€™s important:The Indian market for electric vehicles could be following a global trend of slowing sales after a euphoric 2023. Hybrid sales in India could pick up though if other states follow Uttar Pradesh cue on waiving off registration charges, substantially reducing initial purchase costs.  ",2024-09-06 08:26

But over the short-term, a key trigger buoying the markets is falling crude prices. This time around falling oil prices arenâ€™t indicative of sluggish demand, but heightened supply. Non-OPEC oil producers are chipping away at the stalwartâ€™s market-share, flooding the markets with cheaper fuel. While oil has exited the stage to give renewable energy its share of the limelight, we all know who is running the show behind the scenes. Experts estimate that demand for crude oil is likely to surge, as the burgeoning AI-sector will only expand, and with it, the need for fuel. In a recent update, Google-parent Alphabet gave up its â€˜carbon-zeroâ€™ claim as its bet on artificial intelligence led to emissions soaring by around 50 percent, while other tech giants have doubled down on purchasing carbon offsets. However, Goldman Sachs shares a contrarian view to most oil experts: AI will actually weigh on oil prices. Artificial intelligence could improve logistics capabilities and boost oil production, leading to higher supply which will push oil prices down. Regardless, it seems like oil isnâ€™t going away anytime soon, and the AI revolution could be a make-or-break moment, driving (or curtailing) demand in unprecedented manners. The markets, as always, are watching closely. Uno Minda (Rs 1,132, -3%) Kotak Institutional Equities downgraded the stock to a 'sell' rating. Bear case:Growth momentum to moderate amid slowdown in passenger vehicle segment and new porduct addition coupled with capacity expansion to drag margins lower. KIE also sees risk reward for the stock as unfavourable due to expensive valuations. Bull case:Despite moderation, the company is likely to continue to outperform industry growth driven by the premiumization trend across 2W and 4W, strong order wins and market share expansion. Suzlon Energy (Rs 76.25, +2.8%) The company sold and leased back its prime real estate in Pune for five years, raising Rs 4.4 billion. Bull Case:The capital will be used to enhance execution capabilities. Company is expected to secure over 2GW of additional orders in FY25 and FY26. Government plans to tender 10GW of wind capacity annually from FY23-27 which might create opportunities for Suzlon. Company is net cash positive with a cash reserve of Rs 13 billion as of June 2024.

OPEC delays plans to output hike.Â JPMorgan has pulled back its buy call on Chinese stocks. Merger to two state-backed Chinese brokerages. Another roadblock in Nippon Steel's takeover of US Steel. All this and much more in today's edition of World Street. Cashing outÂ Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold $760 million worth of Bank of America sharesâ€”one of its largest holdingsâ€”over the past three sessions, according to regulatory filings on Friday.Â The sale of 18.7 million shares has further bolstered Berkshireâ€™s cash reserves, now standing at $277 billion, with a total of $6.97 billion raised from trimming its stake in the bank since July. Despite these sales, Berkshire remains Bank of America's largest shareholder, holdingÂ  an 11 percent stake valued at $34.7 billion. Change of plans OPEC+ has decided to delay its planned oil output increase for two months after prices tumbled due to weak demand and abundant supply. Key coalition members opted not to proceed with the scheduled hike of 180,000 barrels per day in October, according to a Bloomberg report. As news of the pause broke, oil prices rose by over 1 percent. The shiftÂ follows disappointing economic data from China and the US, the worldâ€™s largest oil consumers, which had pushed crude prices below $73 a barrel earlier in the week, hitting their lowest point since late 2023. While the dip in prices offers some relief to consumers grappling with inflation, it remains too low for countries like Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to meet their fiscal needs. Relentless delays According to Reuters on Wednesday, the White House is reportedly close to announcing that President Joe Biden will block the Japanese company's $15 billion bid for US Steel, citing national security concerns. The deal is facing growing bipartisan opposition ahead of theÂ US presidential elections, with a powerful labor union also opposing the takeover of Pennsylvania-basedÂ US Steel, a key player in a swing state crucial for both Democrats and Republicans. While both companies aim to finalize the deal by year-end, its sensitivity is heightened by the close US-Japan alliance and Japan's position as the largest foreign investor in the US. Fear unlocked JPMorgan hasÂ snapped its buy recommendation on Chinese stocks, citing concerns over potential risks of a second tariff war after the US elections in November and growing unease aboutÂ the country's economic outlook. The brokerageÂ downgraded China's rating to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" andÂ suggested investors shift focus to markets like India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia. China's economic growth is falteringâ€”by its own high standardsâ€”and the country is struggling to draw in global investors, who are increasingly favoring other emerging markets like India. Coming Together The merger of two state-backed Chinese brokerages to form a sector leader with $230 billion in assets marks a significant step in Beijing's effort to consolidate the $1.7 trillion brokerage industry amid tough market conditions, according to analysts. Shanghai-based Guotai Junan Securities is set to acquire its rival, Haitong Securities, through a share swap, as announced by both firms on Thursday. The deal is pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. Once finalised, the merged entityâ€”boasting total assets of 1.6 trillion yuan ($225.6 billion)â€”will surpass Citi Securities to become China's largest brokerage. ",2024-09-06 07:56

Guotai Junan Securities Co. will merge with smaller rival Haitong Securities Co. through a share swap, according to statements from both companies on Thursday. The combination of the firms, both partly owned by ShanghaiŌĆÖs state assets administrator, will create a new entity with assets of 1.6 trillion yuan ($230 billion), topping Citic Securities Co. as the largest brokerage. The merger is pending approval from the companiesŌĆÖ boards and shareholders, as well as regulatory authorities. The deal comes a year after President Xi Jinping urged regulators at a finance conference to cultivate a few top-ranked investment banks to compete with Wall Street firms expanding in China. The nationŌĆÖs securities watchdog has also voiced its support consolidation, with a goal of having two to three investment banks that can compete globally by┬Ā2035.

ŌĆ£The combination is conducive to building a first-class investment bank and promoting the high-quality development of the industry,ŌĆØ according to the statements. Profits DeclineThe sector has been hampered by a deals slump and sluggish capital markets as stocks flounder on weak economic growth. Profits have declined in the past few years, and the outlook for earnings remains bleak after industry heavyweights China International Capital Corp. and Citic Securities posted drops in first-half results. Haitong, valued at HK$106 billion ($13.6 billion) in Hong Kong, reported a 75% decrease in profit for the first half, while its shares are down 12% on the year. ŌĆ£The merger will potentially resolveŌĆØ HaitongŌĆÖs business concerns, Hua Chuang Securities said in a report. ŌĆ£The overall quality of the underlying assets is not very healthy, which also leads to the low valuation.ŌĆØ Under the agreement, Guotai Junan will issue shares to be listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange to holders of HaitongŌĆÖs A shares, and do the same in Hong Kong with H shares.

Berkshire's share of cash holding has more than doubled in just two years, and are now rapidly moving towards the $300 billion mark. One of factors that could explain Buffett's sustained trimming of positions in key stocks could be that he is expecting higher corporate taxes going forward.Â â€śWith present fiscal policies, I think something has to give. And I think higher taxes are quite likely,â€ť Buffett had said during the Berkshire AGM in May 2024. Berkshire has struggled to deploy its cash pile as deals have been hard to come by.

The index stayed above all key moving averages and recorded a higher high-higher low formation, although there was a bearish candlestick pattern resembling a Dark Cloud Cover-like pattern (not a classical one). According to experts, as long as the index holds above the 10-day EMA (25,087), the consolidation is likely to continue in the coming sessions, with resistance at 25,300-25,350. The Bank Nifty is also expected to be rangebound, with support at 51,281 (10-day EMA) and a hurdle at 51,750 on the higher side. On Thursday, the Nifty 50 fell by 54 points to 25,145, continuing the downtrend for another session. The Bank Nifty rose by 73 points to 51,473. On the NSE, 1,437 shares advanced, while 997 shares declined. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Chandan Taparia, Head â€“ Equity Derivatives and Technicals, Wealth Management at MOFSL The Nifty index has been making higher highs and higher lows on a weekly scale for the last four weeks and recently rallied by more than 1,400 points from 23,893 to 25,333. It has remained consolidative between 25,080 and 25,333 for the last five sessions. However, the major trend of the market is positive, and some sort of consolidative move could be seen with a buy-on-decline stance. The index needs to continue holding above the 25,000 level for an upward move towards 25,500 and 25,750, with key support existing at the 24,850 level. India VIX is hovering near 13-14, and the overall lower base supports the bullish stance for buying on declines. Key Resistance: 25,500, 25,750 Key Support: 25,000, 24,850 Strategy: Buy on declines with support at 24,850 for a target towards 25,500-25,750 levels. Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking The 25,000 mark is expected to act as a crucial support. The overall trend remains positive as long as it holds above the 24,950 level on a closing basis. On the upside, resistance can be seen near the 25,330 level, which is close to Nifty's record high. Investors should closely monitor these support and resistance levels for further market cues. If the Nifty surpasses its all-time high, there is potential for continued upward movement in the near term. Key Resistance: 25,250, 25,350 Key Support: 25,050, 24,950 Strategy: Buy on dips near the 25,050 level for a target of 25,250 and 25,350 levels, with a stop-loss of 24,950 on a closing basis. Virat Jagad, Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza The Nifty started on a positive note, but there was some profit-taking observed in the previous session, where a ""Dark Cloud Cover"" pattern appeared on the daily chart. This pattern suggests that sellers are stepping in at higher price levels. Despite this, the index is approaching its 21-day EMA, which could act as a support level. Additionally, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) hit resistance near the overbought region and is now trending downwards. Overall, the market seems to be shifting from neutral to slightly negative. Key Resistance: 25,300, 25,500 Key Support: 25,000, 24,800 Strategy: Sell near 25,200 with a stop-loss of 25,300 for a target of 25,000. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Chandan Taparia, Head â€“ Equity Derivatives and Technicals, Wealth Management at MOFSL The Bank Nifty has been gradually making higher highs and higher lows for the last three weeks but has been underperforming the broader market. It has been stuck between 51,250 and 51,750 for the last five trading sessions, but supports are intact, attracting declines to be bought. The index needs to continue holding above the 51,250 level for an upward move towards 52,000, while support is seen at 51,250 and then 51,000. Key Resistance: 51,750, 52,000 Key Support: 51,250, 51,000 Strategy: Buy on declines with support at 51,000 for a target towards the 52,000 zone. Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking On the downside, strong support is seen around the 51,300-51,000 levels, while resistance is expected around the 51,700-51,900 levels. If the Bank Nifty sustains above the 51,900 level, we may see a strong upward move towards the 52,300-52,500 range. The overall chart structure appears sideways to positive, with the index trading within the 51,000-51,700 range. However, if the Bank Nifty closes below the mentioned support levels, further correction could be witnessed. Traders are advised to maintain a strict stop-loss to manage risk effectively and to book quick profits during trades. Key Resistance: 51,700, 51,900 Key Support: 51,300, 51,000 Strategy: Buy on dips near the 51,300 level for a target of 51,700-51,900 levels, with a stop-loss of 51,000 on a closing basis. Virat Jagad, Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza The Bank Nifty has been consolidating for the past 30 sessions, stuck in a wide range between 49,700 and 51,700. To move higher, it needs to stay above the upper end of this range. On the daily chart, a small negative candle with short shadows on both ends indicates indecision among traders. The RSI is also near the midline, which supports the sideways movement. For the Bank Nifty to resume its upward trend, it needs to break above the 51,700 level. Key Resistance: 51,700, 52,000 Key Support: 51,100, 50,800 Strategy: Sell 51,700 strike Call and 51,100 strike Put for the current series expiry. ",2024-09-05 22:16

""The wedding season is strong, and the coming 6-9 months should drive strong growth,"" Chairman Gautam Singhania told media persons on the sidelines of the listing event.

Raymond Lifestyle has set out a revenue growth target of 12-15 percent over next 3-5 years with a targetted EBITDA of Rs 2,000 crore by FY28.

In comparison, only two of Quant's 22 funds failed to beat the benchmark (five funds were added over the past 12 months), over the past one year.

In a stark deviation from most traditional fund managers' long-term approach, the Sandeep Tandon-led fund house believes in a high churn rate.Â ""Portfolio turnover ratio is an irrelevant measure because whether the portfolio turnover is high or low does not inherently provide meaningful information about the portfolio's ability to generate returns or manage risk,"" said Quant MF's September factsheet.

The countryâ€™s focus on manufacturing has increased, especially amid its ongoing trade war with the US and lagging real estate market. China's manufacturing activity dropped to a six-month low in August, with factory gate prices falling and factory owners struggling to secure orders, according to an official survey released on Saturday. The National Bureau of Statistics purchasing managers' index declined to 49.1 from 49.4 in July, marking its sixth consecutive decline and the fourth month when the reading came below the 50 threshold that indicates contraction. Following a disappointing second earnings quarter, the world's second-largest economy continued to lose momentum in July, pushing policymakers to consider shifting away from their usual strategy of heavy infrastructure spending. Instead, they are now signaling plans to direct more stimulus towards households. Also Read|ÂChart of the Day: Is Chinaâ€™s steel output decline the answer to the Indian steel producersâ€™ woes? However, this wasnâ€™t always the case. Foreign inflows into China declined following the US-imposed sanctions, with key reductions seen in the lagging Chinese real estate sector. China has poured money into private manufacturing, focusing on automobiles, telecom, electronics, transport, computers, and electro-mechanic equipment. The US imposed sanctions in 2018 after its trade deficit with China swelled to a massive $415 billion, reflecting US reliance on imports coming in from China. As a result of concerns on China's trade practices, growing economic power and worries of intellectual property theft, the US imposed billions of dollars worth of tariffs on Chinese goods from 2018. . Following the impositions, the US has drastically reduced exports to China by around 50 percent and vice versa, China's exports to the US have also reduced by roughly 50 percent. However, to maintain the trade balance there has been a 10-15 percent increase in China's exports to the rest of the world, added Gupta. The worldâ€™s second largest economy started producing and manufacturing a large amount of heavy industrial goods to combat the sanctions. They aimed to increase self-sufficiency and depend less on imports for production, noted Arnav Gupta, a researcher at Bombay Scottish School. Over the past few years, China has shifted its focus to the production of EVs, solar, and overall sustainable goods, turning into one of the biggest producers in this category. The country's exports of solar cells, which the US is raising tariffs on, have more than doubled in the past four years, to $44 billion last year. China also shifted its export strategy, with a higher focus on Asian countries. China exports continue to grow strongly and have increased from $2,494 billion to $3,388 billion, marking a 36 percent increase. Its exports to Russia, Thailand, Australia, Taiwan and Indonesia have risen rapidly. This is why the decline in Chinese manufacturing data, despite efforts to boost self-sufficiency and manufacturing capacity, is raising red flags among experts and will be a key indicator to watch.

New retail policies grew by 27 percent, and the renewal premium rose 10Â percent to Rs 3,323 crore, bringing the total gross written premium to Rs 5,399 crore.

NomuraÂ also believes thatÂ Max's life insurance business would need to deliver much higher Value of New Business (VNB) growth to meet its margin guidance of 25-26 percent in FY25.

It hasÂ lifted valuations in the secondary market to uncomfortable levels and waved off SEBI's constant red flags about froth in the risky SME segment, retail investors are back for more. While the market, whether primary or secondary-- seems to have lost touch with valuations, professional investors are also slowly learning to make peace with it. Take Morgan Stanley for example, the brokerage highlighted that even professional investors are just as stunned as anyone else by the market's ability to bulldoze through worry after worry in its relentless bull run. As for valuations, Morgan Stanley believes that while high valuations alone aren't typically the cause for a market correction, they can act as a catalyst when faced with shifts in fundamentals or market sentiment. Despite that, Morgan Stanley isn't calling it quits on this bull run just yet. In fact, they think the rally is only halfway through its journey. However, with global markets sending out some pretty clear distress signals, driven by concerns of a growth slowdown, the dream run might hit a speed bump as India too is feeling the same dilemma. A potential slowdown in growth for the first time since COVID and the change in the pace of government spending are spreading jitters across investors. While thereâ€™s no guarantee that these concerns will trigger a much-needed market correction, Morgan Stanley is already gearing up for the possibility. The firm sees any potential correction as a golden ticket for those waiting on the sidelinesâ€”because who knows what turn the story will take after the interval? Azad Engineering (Rs 1,573, +4.3%) Investec initiated coverage with a 'buy' call, sees a 23% upside. Bull Case: Azad Engineering is likely to record 40 percent PAT CAGR over FY24 to FY27, while its working capital moderates and RoICs will improve. The aerospace component manufacturer's business model, along with its growth prospects, are giving investors the chance to invest in multiple attractive macro themes, said the brokerage. Bear Case: The firm has over 75 percent of its revenue from exports. In case of export tariffs or volatility in foreign markets, it can seriously impact the firm's revenues. Coal India (Rs 505, -3%) Nuvama cut the target price of stock to Rs 542 from Rs 567. Bull Case: Despite short-term challenges, JM Financial's outlook on the company remains positive due to record-high power demand and a renewed focus on thermal capacity addition. Company has committed to a production target of 908 MT in its MoU with the Ministry of Coal, higher than 838 MT target set by the Government of India for Coal India for FY25. Bear Case: Company reported production of 46.1 MT in August, a 12 percent decline year-on-year due to extended monsoon rains affecting key coal-producing states like Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. Average e-auction prices fell to Rs 2,336 per ton in August and are likely to remain under pressure. Global coal prices have fallen significantly due to oversupply in China. Hindustan Petroleum Corp (Rs 444.75, +4.4%) Scaled a fresh 52-week high on the back of a continuous decline in Brent crude prices. Bull Case: Downward orientation of Brent crude prices and expectations of muted prices through FY25 remains a positive. HSBC also expects low government interference in pump prices, ensuring strong margins. Demerger of lubricant business and its consequent listing can further unlock value, MOFSL wrote. Bear Case: An uptick in oil prices due to any geopolitical upheaval may derail growth trajectory. Despite strong growth prospects, RoE continues to remain poor, MOFSL highlighted.

Of the shares on the NSE, 1,116 advanced while 1,312 declined. The index may rebound after this minor correction, although consolidation appears to be ongoing. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Hindustan Petroleum Corporation| CMP: Rs 445.1  Since breaking out of a Cup and Handle pattern on the monthly scale in December 2023, HPCL has maintained its upward trend. On the weekly scale, it recently broke out of a six-month congestion zone and has continued to form higher highs and higher lows, indicating a sustained upward trajectory. Momentum indicators, such as the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), are in buy mode on both the weekly and daily scales. Additionally, the ratio chart of HPCL against the Nifty has shown a breakout from a double bottom formation, suggesting robust performance ahead. Looking forward, the stock has potential upside with a target of Rs 520, while a stop-loss at Rs 409 on a closing basis is recommended for effective risk management. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 520 Stop-Loss: Rs 409 Deepak Nitrite| CMP: Rs 2,988.7  On the monthly scale, Deepak Nitrite displayed a strong price structure from 2019 to 2021, followed by a healthy consolidation phase lasting 2.5 years. In July 2024, the stock broke out of this consolidation zone, suggesting a likely continuation of its upward momentum. On the weekly scale, the stock formed a bottom near the 12-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average), while the daily chart shows a breakout from a falling channel, indicating a bullish alignment across multiple timeframes. The MACD study reveals a higher bottom pattern, signaling that momentum is gaining strength. Looking ahead, the stock has potential upside with a target of Rs 3,432, while a stop-loss at Rs 2,745 on a closing basis is recommended for effective risk management. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,432 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,745 Piramal Pharma| CMP: Rs 213  Piramal Pharma's chart structure looks compelling, as the stock recently broke out above its listing day high, signaling its readiness to enter new territory. On the weekly scale, after the breakout, the stock entered a tight consolidation phase. This week, it broke out of that zone with strong volume participation. The stock is well-positioned above its 12-week and 26-week EMAs, indicating a positive trend, while the MACD study shows waves in positive territory, confirming that bullish momentum remains intact. Looking ahead, the stock appears poised for further gains, with a target of Rs 260. To manage risks effectively, a stop-loss at Rs 194 on a closing basis is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 260 Stop-Loss: Rs 194 Caplin Point Laboratories| CMP: Rs 1,967  Caplin Point Laboratories exhibits a strong price structure on the monthly scale, with a higher top and higher bottom formation. A similar pattern is observed on the weekly scale, where recent volume activity has surged above the 20-week average, indicating significant participation in the rising price. The MACD momentum indicator is also in buy mode, moving higher in positive territory. Looking ahead, the stock has potential for further upside, with a target of Rs 2,360. To manage risks effectively, a stop-loss at Rs 1,809 on a closing basis is recommended. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,360 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,809 Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan Avenue Supermarts| CMP: Rs 5,100.9  Avenue Supermarts (DMart) has formed a Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the daily charts. We expect this consolidation to break out on the upside. The daily momentum indicator has started a new cycle from the equilibrium line, suggesting that the stock is poised for a sharp run-up over the next few trading sessions. We anticipate the stock to target levels of Rs 5,300 â€“ 5,500. A stop-loss of Rs 4,950 should be maintained for long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,300, Rs 5,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 4,950 Apollo Tyres| CMP: Rs 508.7  Apollo Tyres has completed a five-wave decline on the daily charts and is currently in the process of retracing that fall. The daily momentum indicator has shown a positive crossover, which is a buy signal. We expect the stock to retrace the decline and target levels of Rs 533 â€“ 548 in the short term. A stop-loss of Rs 497 should be maintained for long positions. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 533, Rs 548 Stop-Loss: Rs 497 Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities Prism Johnson| CMP: Rs 182.3  Over the past few weeks, Prism Johnson has been trading within a broader range of Rs 155 to Rs 175, with prices fluctuating around its 200-day EMA on daily charts. At this juncture, the stock has given a fresh breakout after a prolonged consolidation phase. The price action is accompanied by increased volumes, suggesting potential upside. Therefore, one can buy, hold, or accumulate the stock with an expected upside target of Rs 210â€“215, and a downside support zone of Rs 175â€“170. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 210, Rs 215 Stop-Loss: Rs 160 Indoco Remedies| CMP: Rs 374.6  After hitting a 52-week low of Rs 286.60, Indoco Remedies has experienced a steady recovery, with prices rising from Rs 286 to Rs 360 over the past few months, forming a pattern of higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. Currently, the stock has given a fresh breakout above a symmetrical triangle pattern on short-term charts, while a trendline breakout has been observed on broader charts. Therefore, one can buy, hold, or accumulate the stock with an expected upside of Rs 425â€“430, and a downside support zone of Rs 365â€“360. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 425, Rs 430 Stop-Loss; Rs 340 Asahi India Glass| CMP: Rs 678.3 Asahi India Glass experienced a significant decline recently, dropping from Rs 720 to Rs 600 as part of a corrective phase. However, it found support around its 200-day EMA on the daily time frame and has since bounced back. The stock has been trading in a pattern of higher lows, indicating a potential reversal and continuation of its previous trend, as it has also broken out above a symmetrical triangle pattern. Therefore, one can buy, hold, or accumulate the stock with an expected upside of Rs 790â€“795, and a downside support zone of Rs 670â€“660. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs Rs 790, Rs 795 Stop-Loss: Rs 610 ",2024-09-04 21:42

Ashish Kacholia and Vijay Kedia are at odds, with Kacholia arguing against a heavy-handed regulatory approach and Kedia warning of potential market manipulation. Kacholia, an advocate for the SME ecosystem, argued that recent scrutiny and regulatory warnings are misguided. He believed that the current approach of penalizing the entire SME market for the actions of a few companies is detrimental. ""We shouldnâ€™t throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" Kacholia asserted. Instead, he advocated for a regulatory framework that promotes transparency and due diligence. He said that investors are smart and they do their homework. ""Regulation should be a light touch with adequate disclosures and stringent penalties for wrongdoers."" Kacholia recalled the days when small companies like Suven Pharma and Nagarjuna Construction, now industry giants, accessed capital markets with minimal paperwork. He views the SME platform as a crucial avenue for emerging businesses to secure funding and drive innovation. However, he criticised the recent move by the NSE to require positive Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for at least two of the three previous years, questioning how rapidly growing companies can meet such criteria. In stark contrast, Vijay Kedia has voiced concerns about the potential for manipulation within the SME IPO space. Kedia has claimed that ""nine out of ten stocks in the SME space are manipulated"". He believes that both promoters and investors may be engaging in dubious practices, a sentiment echoed by SEBIâ€™s recent cautionary notes about unrealistic post-listing projections and manipulative tactics like bonus issues and stock splits. Kediaâ€™s concerns are bolstered by SEBIâ€™s latest warning, which urges investors to be wary of tips and social media hype surrounding SME stocks. The regulatorâ€™s recent measures, including a 90 percent cap on opening prices for SME IPOs, aim to curb excessive speculation and maintain market integrity. On August 28, the capital markets regulator issued an advisory cautioning investors regarding SME investing, even as small company IPOs continue to see massive oversubscription. SEBI has advised investors to be wary of the companies painting an unrealistic positive picture and also cautioned investors to not fall for social media tips or rumours. The IPO ofResourceful Automobileis a perfect case in point. Running a modest operation with just two Yamaha showrooms and eight employees, the company attracted bids worth nearly a whopping Rs 5,000 crore â€” 420 times its Rs 12-crore target, despite its relatively small scale and past financial losses.

Hence, most experts believe the uptrend is still intact. According to them, if the index manages to close above the 25,300 level, then 25,400-25,500 can't be ruled out in the coming sessions, while the 25,073, the previous swing high (August 1), is expected to be immediate support, with 25,000 being sacrosanct support. As long as the Bank Nifty stays above all key moving averages, the upward journey towards the 51,800-52,000 zone can't be ruled out amid consolidation. On Wednesday, the Nifty 50 was down 81 points at 25,199, snapping a 14-day winning streak. The Bank Nifty dropped 289 points to 51,400. On the NSE, 1,312 shares declined, while 1,116 shares advanced. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan On the daily charts, we can observe that the Nifty has retested the breakout above 25,078, which was the previous swing high. There may be some consolidation over the next few trading sessions; however, the uptrend is still intact. The crucial support zone on the downside is placed at 24,900 â€“ 24,850, and until this zone is not breached on the downside, we expect the Nifty to target levels of 25,500 from a short-term perspective. Key Resistance: 25,300, 25,350 Key Support: 25,100, 25,000 Strategy: Buy Nifty with a stop-loss of 25,120 and a target of 25,300. Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities Selective buying in heavyweight stocks helped trim some losses during the day. This move indicates that the bulls are still keeping control over the markets. From here on, we might see some consolidation in the prices. Technically, the Nifty has a key psychological support at the 25,000 level, and the bias is likely to remain in favor of bulls as long as this level holds. We recommend maintaining a focus on stock selection. Key Resistance: 25,350, 25,450 Key Support: 25,150, 25,000 Strategy: Buy on dips near 25,200, with a stop-loss below 25,050, and a target of 25,450. Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital The RSI (Relative Strength Index) momentum indicator shows negative divergence on both the weekly and daily charts, signaling a cautious outlook for the short to medium term. The Nifty has immediate support at the 25,000 level, followed by 24,800. If the index closes below 24,800, a correction could lead the market down to 24,400, and potentially 23,900. On the upside, resistance is seen at the all-time high of 25,333, followed by the 25,700 level. Key Resistance: 25,333, 25,700 Key Support: 24,800, 24,500 Strategy: Buy Nifty on a dip near 25,000 for a target of 25,400, with a stop-loss of 24,800. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst, Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan The Bank Nifty traded within the range of the previous trading session and formed an Inside Bar pattern on the daily charts, making the extremes of the range 51,750 â€“ 51,240 crucial levels to watch out for during the upcoming trading session. We believe that the Bank Nifty is in a pullback mode and we expect it to continue over the next few trading sessions. On the upside, 51,900 â€“ 52,000 is the immediate hurdle, and crucial support is placed at 51,000 â€“ 50,900. Key Resistance: 51,900, 52,000 Key Support: 51,000, 50,900 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty with a stop-loss of 51,000, and a target of 51,900 - 52,000. Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital The Bank Nifty is outperforming the benchmark Nifty this week, maintaining a higher high, higher low formation on the weekly charts after finding strong support at its 20-week SMA (Simple Moving Average). On the daily charts, the index has been forming a rising wedge pattern over the past few days. The weekly RSI is trending upward and remains above the 60 level, indicating positive momentum for the short to medium term. On the upside, Bank Nifty faces immediate resistance at 51,800, followed by 52,600 and 53,357 levels. On the downside, support is placed at 50,900, followed by 50,300. Key Resistance: 51,800, 52,600 Key Support: 50,900, 50,300 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty if it sustains above 51,800 for a target of 52,600, with a stop-loss of 50,450. Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities The Bank Nifty also witnessed a decline and could not manage to break its crucial hurdle of 52,000 once again. A dip was seen coming towards its critical support level of 51,500, where the index witnessed renewed buying interest. For Bank Nifty, as long as the 51,000 level holds, we can expect a potential rally in the Bank Nifty in the upcoming sessions. On the higher side, the Bank Nifty faces a major hurdle in the zone of 51,900-52,000. Key Resistance: 51,800, 52,000 Key Support: 51,400, 51,200 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty on dips near 51,400, with a stop-loss below 51,000, and a target of 52,000. ",2024-09-04 20:18

Here's a highlight of what Chaudhary said: â€˘ Domestic policy rates have peaked, leading to a favourable demand-supply dynamics and a downward shift in the yield curve by around 30-35 basis points across maturities. â€˘ Despite global growth slowdown, India's growth remains resilient, allowing the Monetary Policy Committee to maintain the status quo. â€˘ The demand-supply equation is favourable for bond prices, with a minimal spread between repo rates and the 10-year G-sec yield. â€˘ Expect a 25 basis point rate cut from the Fed in September, with a clear direction for rate cuts if data continues to indicate strong growth.

A high-profile influencer on social media, BishalŌĆÖs lavish lifestyle was once the talk of the town, luring people to invest in his stock firm without doubting his credentials. The Rise of Bishal Phukan At age 18, Bishal Phukan stepped into the world of stock market for the first time, after graduating in commerce from Salt Brook Academy, Dibrugarh. Though Bishal had a basic understanding of business and finance, he picked up the nuance of making quick money. Bishal used his easy demeanour to lure investors with a promise of 30% return in 60 days, which clicked, and funds started pouring in. As promised, Bishal did deliver the assured returns to investors on time, but only for a while. With his new-found wealth, Bishal soon floated four companies in the business of pharmaceuticals, video production and construction. He invested in production of web series, music videos and in the Assamese film business, along with purchasing land and apartments in Guwahati and Dibrugarh. Bishal moved in swanky cars and frequently travelled to the Middle East. Skydiving in Dubai and hosting large, open-air parties came easily for someone who rose from humble beginnings and had lost his father just a couple of years ago. Bishal Phukan has been charged with defrauding investors in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to the tune of around Rs 2,200 crore in the garb of guaranteed returns. He also funded a destination wedding for his sister in Udaipur, Rajasthan, and paid for her┬Āextravagant Dubai trip with hotel stay and more, hiring rooms worth 12 lakh. What Went Wrong? Another Con Game All was fine until another pan-India stock fraud was unearthed, and people associated with an investment company called DB Stock Broking were arrested for allegedly defrauding thousands of investors to the tune of nearly Rs 7,000 crore. As many as 23,000 investors filed police complaints against DB Stock Broking once┬Āreturns┬Ābecame irregular. It emerged that people associated with the company had offices in Guwahati, Nalbari, Rangia, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Mumbai. Dipankar Barman, the alleged mastermind behind this scam, is still at large and reported to be in Australia, though there have been arrests of people who have had connections with him. The ire of some investors has even led to an assault on Barman's father. DB Stocks allegedly used to invest client's money through Angel One, a marquee online trading platform. Angel One has distanced itself from DB Stock Broking scam, stating that Dipankar BurmanŌĆÖs company was not on their list of associates. Circling Back to BishalŌĆÖs Trading Game Investigation in this scam pointed the needle of suspicion towards Bishal Phukhan and his company, which had been receiving money through notary, an unlawful activity as per capital market regulator SEBI. As the noose tightened, the young trader responded with a statement on his Facebook account, and said, ŌĆ£I have returned all the money to the persons with whom I have entered. Under the Indian law, taking money by way of valid agreement under the Indian contract Act is no offence. Investing the money in buying stocks using my demat account is no offence under the law. Furthermore, I assure every person from whom via agreement I received money in my bank accounts that their money is safe and would be returned, if at all they want it back within discussed period as per agreement.ŌĆØ On September 2, Dibrugarh Police investigated Phukan at his residence for over four hours, and later arrested him along with manager, Biplab, under a non-bailable offense. A security personnel from BishalŌĆÖs apartment too has been arrested, and Guwahati police is on the lookout for BishalŌĆÖs┬Āsister Sumi Bora, a choreographer by profession, who had managed to spend several hundred times more than her disclosed income. Dirhams and high-end phones were recovered during the search on Bishal Phukan and cousin Sumi BoraŌĆÖs residences, along with what is being described by police as incriminating documents. Taking cognizance of the massive fraud, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has ordered state police to initiate a campaign against stock trading fraud and assured to investigate complaints.

Then there is Vikasa India EIF I Fund whose name appears as an anchor investor in 25 SME IPOs though the Mauritius-based FPI invests in SME IPOs through more than one fund. Foreign portfolio investors like NAV Capital VCC - NAV Capital Emerging Star Fund, Craft Emerging Market Fund PCC - Citadel Capital Fund and Astorne Capital VCC â€“ Arven are also among the top FPIs in the SME IPO segment, having participated in more than 20 IPOs as anchor investors in the current calendar year.  Market experts believe that a trend of select set of investors cornering the anchor book of all SME IPOs is not a healthy one and the regulator should review the framework for the segment. â€śThe typical size of an SME IPO is in the range of just Rs 15-30 crore and a dedicated portion for QIBs, including the anchor book, creates very small size buckets for other investors,â€ť says Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services. â€śMutual funds also hardly participate in the SME IPO segment due to size constraints and so it would be best to just have two broad categories for HNIs and retail,â€ť he added. Indeed, as data shows that while FPIs along with venture capital players and even a few Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) do invest in SME IPOs through the anchor book, there is hardly any interest from the mutual fund industry. Incidentally, most of the SME IPOs that were launched this year saw the anchor book getting allocated amongst 5-6 institutional investors. On a different note, the SME IPO segment is already under the scanner of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and of the stock exchanges as well who also act as first level regulators â€“ BSE and NSE launched their separate dedicated platforms for SME IPOs in 2012. In July, NSE announced that it would place an overall capping of 90 percent over the issue price for SME IPOs during special pre-open session on the day of listing. In March, SEBI chairperson Madhabi Puri Buchhad said that the market regulator has noticed â€śsigns of manipulation in the SME segmentâ€ť. However, there is also a section of market participants that believes that an increasing number of institutional investors are participating in the SME IPO arena, which is enhancing the credibility of the segment as well. â€śThe growing involvement of institutional investors in SME IPOs is a promising development for the sector. With increased participation from well-known funds and banks, the SME market is gaining credibility and attracting significant interest,â€ť says Kresha Gupta, Director & Fund Manager, Chanakya Opportunities Fund, a SEBI-registered Cat II AIF that invests in SME IPOs. â€śAs of today, there have been more than 125 institutions who have participated in the SME IPOs through anchor investments. And this showcases a strong interest. We are not aware of the exact number of institutions participating under the QIB quota but judging by the oversubscription under QIB allocations, the participation from institutional investors is very high,â€ť adds Gupta. Interestingly, HDFC Bank has participated as an anchor investor in four SME IPOs this year. The private sector lender has put in a little over Rs 12 crore in total in ABS Marine Services, Ganesh Green Bharat, Afcom Holdings, Sathlokhar Synergys E&C Global. ",2024-09-04 16:22

However, the index found initial support at the historical swing high. Going forward, the index might consolidate between 25,080 and 25,250. A drop below 25,080 could trigger further correction towards 24800-24750/24500; while a move beyond 25,236 might induce a rally toward higher levels.

In the backdrop are their pending application with the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), seeking exemption from BO disclosure requirements under SEBI's circular dated 24 August 2023 (Circular). The current situation, affecting a significant number of FPIs, is a result of SEBIâ€™s policy regarding granular BO disclosure by certain type of FPIs, i.e., those whose concentration in a single Indian corporate group or overall equity Assets Under Management (AUM) in the Indian markets exceeds the thresholds specified in the Circular. Original deadlines FPIs which were in breach of either of these thresholds, unless exempt, were required to realign their Indian equity holdings below the relevant thresholds, within 90 days from 1 November 2023. Failure to bring down their equity holdings below the thresholds obligated such FPIs to furnish granular details of their BOs within the next 30 days. Non-disclosure rendered their license invalid and mandated the liquidation of their holdings within the next 180 days. Post expiry of the 180-day period, FPIs have an additional window of 180 days to liquidate their holdings, subject to payment of a financial disincentive of 5% of sale proceeds towards SEBIâ€™s Investor Protection and Education Fund. Mid-course policy change The controversy emanates out of SEBIâ€™s mid-way change in its policy to withdraw the exemption allowed to certain type of Pooled Investment Vehicles (PIVs) from furnishing granular BO details. The Circular exempts four category of FPIs that don't pose systemic risks or face genuine constraints in adhering to the specified limits, from having to furnish granular BO details, including regulated PIVs whose India allocation remains below a certain percentage of their global AUM. The specific eligibility criteria to claim exemption was detailed in a subsequently issued Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), jointly issued by Designated Depository Participants (DDPs) in September 2023, reflecting SEBIâ€™s policy on the subject. Another change in February 2024 However, in February 2024, SEBI directed DDPs to place on hold exemption requests of PIVs. In absence of any express amendment to the SOP, FPIs otherwise eligible for exemption were faced with a unique challenge to either make a granular BO disclosure or risk having their license rendered invalid. This was a significant setback for FPIs which were eligible for exemption and did not initiate steps to identify granular BOs details or to pare down their holdings within the stipulated window. It was only in late May 2024 that the SEBIâ€™s directives to DDPs were formally documented in an amended SOP. The Section 43B carve out In the interregnum, lacking a direct platform to engage with the SEBI, FPIs were advised by their DDPs to file applications under Regulation 43B of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations 2019 (FPI Regulations), that empowers SEBI to exempt FPIs from strict enforcement of the regulations if the non-compliance is caused by factors beyond their control or if the requirement is procedural or technical in nature. Pending applications As things stand today, in the absence of any statutory timeline provided under the FPI Regulations for disposing of applications under Regulation 43(B), FPIs are unsure about the fate of their pending applications in view of the impending September 9, 2024 deadline. It is the case of FPIs that their license should not be rendered invalid, and they ought to be granted exemption, as their right to claim exemption accrued in their favour when they approached DDPs seeking exemption and the same cannot be taken away by way of change in policy apparently communicated only to DDPs without bringing a retrospective amendment. FPIs have also been quick to point out that SEBI has already issued four consultation papers and three circulars concerning this subject matter. Therefore, it would have been ideal if, prior to implementing the policy, an in-depth consultation on this subject matter had been carried out, or at least the deadlines were kept in abeyance pending further clarity on the matter. In view of the impending deadline, one would hope that the pending applications would be disposed of expeditiously in accordance with law, so that FPIs are not handed over aÂfait accompli. Further, there may be FPIs who have realigned their portfolio or met the granular BO disclosure requirements, albeit post the cut-off dates. It would be ideal if SEBI considers taking a more pragmatic approach of allowing such FPIs to continue with their now compliant structure rather than forcing them to close down the existing structures. There are significant costs and hardship involved in winding-down a structure and to recreate a fresh structure. Importantly, it may also send a negative message to the global investors regarding the stability of the regulatory regime, forcing them to rethink their India strategy, especially whether to reinvest the liquidated positions back to Indian market.

A decline in crude prices benefits oil marketing companies (OMCs) and paint manufacturers as that reduces their input costs and gives them more leeway to generate higher margins. In addition to that, OMCs can also capitalise on inventory gains by restocking at reduced prices. Also, lower fuel prices may boost consumer demand, driving higher sales volumes, and lifting revenues for these players. Buoyed by these positive triggers driven by a fall in crude prices, shares of OMC companies likeHPCL,BPCLandIOCLrose 1-3.5 percent in trade on September 4. Gains in the segment were led by HPCL, which rose 3.5 percent and hit a record high of RsÂ 442.50 on the NSE. Paint stocks also glimmered in the green, withAsian Paints,Indigo Paints,Shalimar PaintsandBerger Paints Indiagaining 1.5-5 percent. However, on the flipside, the fall in crude prices will have a negative bearing on oilÂ drilling stocks like ONGC and Oil India as it squeezes their profit margins. This is because the price of refined products may not drop as quickly or proportionately and hence, refineries holding inventories bought at higher prices may face inventory losses as the value of their stock decreases.

Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Brent crude prices fell to their lowest levels in almost nine months, slipping closer to $73 per barrel, marking a sharp fall from a high of over $81 per barrel last week. Pressure on Brent prices is stemming from concerns of a demand slowdown in China, the world's largest importer of the commodity, due to an increased adoption of electric vehicles. Additionally, the prospect of resolving the dispute that has stalled Libyan crude production and exports adds pressure due to the potential for excess supply. Expectations of increased OPEC+ production starting in October, intended to offset a sharp decline in Libyan output, further contribute to the downward pressure. According to Reuters, OPEC+ plans to boost oil output in October, with eight member countries increasing production by 180,000 barrels per day.

The said roles are for System Engineers (SE) and Digital Specialist Engineers (DSE), who say they have sat for two pre-training sessions, with the latest one being in August. Of this, about 500 are for SE roles from the 2022 batch while around 200 are DSE candidates from the 2023 batch. These DSE candidates were hired after clearing the advanced â€śHackWithInfyâ€ť competition in 2022, during their third year of the four-year engineering degree. Indiaâ€™s second-largest software exporter sent offer letters back in 2022 but did not on-board the candidates after the IT industry faced a slump. This phenomenon, however, is an industry-wide issue. Fears of a looming recession in IT companies' major markets and the absence of discretionary spending led companies to pause hiring, leading to a multi-decadal decline in headcount. On September 3, Infosys sent letters with joining dates to approximately 1,000 freshers from 2022 campus hires, just a day afterit issued similar number of letters, according to the Pune-based employee union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). â€śPeople who have received joining dates till now are mostly those who have completed their pre-training in July 2024,â€ť said one of the candidates mentioned above. â€śWhy are we being made to sit for these assessments again and again when we have successfully run the codes earlier and passed the exams?â€ť For context, candidates were asked to appear for a test that had two coding tests and about 25 multiple-choice questions after completion of pre-training assessments in July, people aware of the matter said. Some candidates allege ad hoc selection criteria for certain freshers who have been issued offer letters so far, claiming many havenâ€™t even attended assessment after completing the pre-training sessions. Moneycontrolhas reached out to Infosys for a comment and the story will be updated as and when the company responds. In July, the Bengaluru-based company stated that a small portion of the earlier hires were pending. The issue began when the company reached out to candidates, who were issued offer letters in 2022, a couple of months ago. Since then, candidates have complained that multiple rounds of pre-training sessions and assessments have made them apprehensive about the whole process of hiring. They question why, despite receiving offer letters in 2022 and completing assessments as recently as August, they are being asked to go through the process repeatedly. Fate of DSE candidates Freshers who have received offer letters till now are mostly candidates for the SE roles and that too from the batch that passed out in 2022. However, around 200 DSE candidates from the 2023 batch now fear that they might not receive offer letters at all. â€śSE candidates made noise which added pressure to the company to take action but since we are less in number when compared to the 2022 batch, we think our issue might be brushed aside,â€ť said one of the candidates. â€śWill they hire two SE candidates in place of one DSE candidate and leave us behind?â€ť asked another 2023 batch fresher. While the salary of a SE commanded Rs 3.6 lakh per annum, the position of DSE fetched Rs 6.5 lakh per annum, according to the people mentioned above. To be sure, about 100 out of 300 selected candidates have received offer letters from the DSE pool, people aware of the matter said. Some of the DSE candidates thatMoneycontrolspoke with said they have been informed that an assessment will be held offline. However, details such as date and location are yet to be communicated. Recently,Â InfosysÂ CEO SalilParekh indicated that offers given to freshers would be honouredby the company and followed with joining, although there has been some change in dates. ""Every offer that we have given, that offer will be someone who will join the company. We changed some dates but beyond that everyone will join Infosys and there is no change in that approach,""Â Parekh had said. Pune-based IT employee unionNITES had earlier filed a requestto the Ministry of Labour & Employment to investigate the company for the â€śexploitation and unprofessional treatmentâ€ť of 2,000 engineering graduates, who were selected for SE and DSE roles during the 2022-23 recruitment drive. Infosys had hired over 50,000 freshers in financial year 2022-23 from campuses, whichplunged to nearly 11,900 college graduatesin FY23-24, CEO and MD Salil Parekh, said in the companyâ€™s annual report released on June 3.

Nevertheless, significant capital from new investors has flowed into mid-cap and small-cap funds over the past two years, as noted by Kotak.

Market across Asia sank in losses, with technology and chipmaker stocks witnessing a selloff on the back of weak cues from US counterparts. US PMI data for August witnessed a slowdown sparking worries over an economic slowdown in the world's largest economy.Â All this and much more on World Street. Taking a break US factories continued toÂ witnessÂ a slowdown in August,Â sparkingÂ fearsÂ over the future of the economy and thereby triggering a selloff in the equity market. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) monthly survey revealed that only 47.2 percent of purchasing managers reported expansion, falling short of the 50Â percent threshold that indicates growth. While this figure was a slight improvement from July's 46.8Â percent, it still came in below the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 47.9 percent. Stair fall Nvidia's shares plunged 9.5 percent on Tuesday, marking the steepest single-day drop in market value ever recorded by a US company, as investorÂ optimism for artificial intelligence cooled amid a broader market selloff triggered by lukewarm economic data. The plunge wiped out $279 billion from Nvidia's market capitalisation,Â hinting towards growing investor caution towards the AI technology that has driven significant stock market gains this year. I see Red! Asia-Pacific markets took a dive on Wednesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 leading theÂ fall,Â tracking a selloff in US tech stocks and rising recession fears triggered by weak US economic data. The Nikkei 225 dropped 3.19 percent, while the broader Topix index fell 2.79 percent. Semiconductor-related stocks were hit particularly hard, with Renesas Electronics plummeting 8 percent, making it the biggest loser on the index. Tokyo Electron slid 7 percent, and Advantest tumbled almost 8percent. SoftBank Group, which owns chip designer Armâ€”a key supplier for Nvidiaâ€”saw its shares fall over 5.9Â percent.Â Â South Korea's Kospi index dropped 2.17 percent, with chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, both key suppliers to Nvidia, slipping 2.62Â percent and 6.36 percent, respectively. Taiwan's Weighted Index alsoÂ recordedÂ a significant fall of over 3Â percent before trimming some losses. Major players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) fell 3.5 percent, while Hon Hai Precision Industry, known globally as Foxconn, slid over 3.5 percent. Bracing for a fight German automotive giant Volkswagen is gearing up for a potential clash with trade unions after announcing that it may not be able to avoid shutting down factories in its home countryâ€”a first in the companyâ€™s nearly 90-year history. Volkswagenâ€™s management is set to present its plans to around 18,000 workers during a town hall meeting in Wolfsburg on Wednesday amid rumors that the company might consider closing its Osnabrueck and Dresden sites. This development highlights theÂ growing challenges faced by Europeâ€™s legacy carmakers as VolkswagenÂ cautionedÂ that it could no longer rule out plant closures in Germany. Sliding down Oil prices plunged nearly 5 percent overnight, falling to their lowest levels in almost nine months, amid signs of a potential resolution to the dispute that has halted Libyan crude production and exports. Brent crude futures dropped $3.77, or 4.9 percent, closing at $73.75 per barrelâ€”their lowest since December 12.Â The correction follows last week's weak performance, where Brent prices slipped from $80 per barrel to below $75 per barrel.Â  The drop in oil prices came at a time when news surfaced that Libya's legislative bodies have agreed to appoint a new central bank governor within 30 days, following UN-sponsored talks. This development comesÂ amid a halt inÂ  major Libyan oil exports and reduced production due to an ongoing standoff between rival political factions over control of the central bank and oil revenue. Bad omen Artificial intelligence (AI) couldÂ hurt oilÂ prices over the next decade byÂ improving supply through cost reductions in logistics and increasing the volume of profitably recoverable resources, analysts at Goldman Sachs believe. While much of the focus on AI's impact has been on the anticipated rise in power demand, its potential to lower oil prices could significantly affect the incomes of producers, including members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+).Â Goldman Sachs estimates that AI could potentially reduce the costs of drilling a new shale well by around 30 percent. Moreover, AI-driven improvements in the low recovery factors of US shale could lead to a 10Â percent to 20Â percent increase in oil reserves, adding an estimated 10 to 30 billion barrels.

moneycontrol.com,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/asia-tracks-worst-us-selloff-since-august-crash-12813880.html,Asia tracks worst US selloff since August crash,Asian markets tumble as Wall Street's tech-driven selloff spreads fears of global slowdown.Related stories.,"Stocks in Asia sank after Wall Street posted its worst day since the Aug. 5 rout, as weak US data and falling oil prices raised concerns about the health of the global economy. Japan led the slump, with the Nikkei 225 down over 3%. Shares also fell in Australia and South Korea, while futures pointed to losses in Hong Kong. US contracts edged lower in early Asian trading after the S&P 500 fell more than 2%, with Nvidia Corp. driving a plunge in tech stocks. The risk-off mood came as the yen jumped and a closely watched US manufacturing gauge again missed forecasts. A selloff in tech stocks also rekindled worries about undue invesetor frenzy about artificial intelligence. Wall Streetâ€™s â€śfear gaugeâ€ť - the VIX - soared. Treasury yields tumbled, with traders keeping their bets on an unusually large half-point Federal Reserve rate cut this year. A dollar gauge rose for a fifth session, its longest winning streak since April, before falling slightly in early trading on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 saw their worst starts to a September since 2015 and 2002, respectively. With inflation expectations anchored, attention has shifted to the health of the economy as signs of weakness could speed up policy easing. While rate cuts tend to bode well for equities, thatâ€™s not usually the case when the Fed is rushing to prevent a recession. Traders are anticipating the Fed will reduce rates by more than two full percentage points over the next 12 months â€” the steepest drop outside of a downturn since the 1980s. The trepidation after the latest rise in unemployment will leave traders â€śon edgeâ€ť until Fridayâ€™s payrolls data, said Ian Lyngen and Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. â€śThis weekâ€™s jobs report, while not the sole determinant, will likely be a key factor in the Fedâ€™s decision between a 25 or 50 basis-point cut,â€ť said Jason Pride and Michael Reynolds at Glenmede. â€śEven modest signals in this weekâ€™s jobs report could be a key decision point as to whether the Fed takes a more cautious or aggressive approach.â€ť The S&P 500 dropped to around 5,530 while the Nasdaq 100 lost over 3% as Nvidia tumbled 9.5% â€” erasing $279 billion in a record one-day wipeout for a US stock. The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws. US 10-year yields steadied after falling seven basis points to 3.83%, and the equivalent Australian note lost seven points early Wednesday. The yen climbed Tuesday as Bank of Japanâ€™s Kazuo Ueda reiterated the central bank will continue to raise rates if the economy and prices perform as expected. Marking the start of a busy week for economic data, a report showed US manufacturing activity shrank in August for a fifth month. The Morgan Stanley strategist who foresaw last monthâ€™s market correction says firms that have lagged the rally in US stocks could get a boost if Fridayâ€™s jobs data provide evidence of a resilient economy. A stronger-than-expected payrolls number would likely give investors â€śgreater confidence that growth risks have subsided,â€ť Michael Wilson wrote. The August jobs report is expected to show payrolls in the worldâ€™s largest economy increased by about 165,000, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. While above the modest 114,000 gain in July, average payrolls growth over the most recent three months would ease to a little more than 150,000 â€” the smallest since the start of 2021. The jobless rate probably edged down in August, to 4.2% from 4.3%. While the Fed is finally coming around to cutting rates, it does not feel like stringing out a bunch of 25 basis-point rate cuts will do the job, said Neil Dutta at Renaissance Macro Research. Under that scenario, it will take a long time to return the funds rate to neutral and in the process, youâ€™ll keep policy restrictive, keeping open downside risks to growth. â€śThat muddling through scenario will probably risk further increases in the unemployment rate,â€ť he said. â€śSo, if they arenâ€™t going 50 in September, they are going to need to go 50 at some point later this year.â€ť ",2024-09-04 07:48

According to him, FMCG also offers stability in uncertain times, making it an attractive long-term investment. In case of pharma space, investors should focus on companies with robust R&D pipelines and strong balance sheets for sustained returns, said Bhave with more than 25 years of experience in scaling up wealth management ventures. He had earlier worked with Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ICICI Bank, and Karvy Private Wealth. Do you see big opportunity of investment in FMCG space? Yes. One would remember in school we used to write essays on the topic â€śIndian Population - boon or baneâ€ť. Indiaâ€™s demographic dividend continues to remain a boon for the FMCG sector & hence this sector continues to present a compelling investment opportunity. Despite the challenges posed by inflation and shifting consumer preferences, the sector is resilient, driven by rising demand, especially in new geographies, including tier 3 cities & towns. With the increasing penetration of organized retail and e-commerce, as well as rising disposable incomes in rural and urban areas, FMCG companies are well-positioned to capture the India growth story. Additionally, the ongoing shift towards premiumization and health-conscious products is creating new avenues for expansion. As a defensive sector, FMCG also offers stability in uncertain times, making it an attractive long-term investment. Do you still expect significant run up in the pharma space? The reality is that as human beings live longer, have improving lifestyles & also increasing stress as a side effect, the pharma sector will continue to enjoy increasing demand. The pharma sector has had a remarkable run, especially during & after the pandemic, but I believe there is still potential for growth, albeit at a more measured pace. The focus on healthcare infrastructure, increasing health awareness, and the push towards innovation in drug development are the key drivers. Moreover, the global demand for generic drugs and biosimilars continues to rise, providing Indian pharma companies with a strong export market. However, the sector might face headwinds such as pricing pressures and regulatory challenges, which could temper the pace of growth. Investors should focus on companies with robust R&D pipelines and strong balance sheets for sustained returns. Are there sectors that you would want to avoid? There is an old Hindi saying, which roughly translated says â€śA lotus blooms even in mudâ€ť. The same is true for select stocks across all sectors, even those that may not be doing that well. At Equirus Wealth, we believe in a bottom-up stock picking approach and both own PMS solutions (small cap and multi-cap strategies) remain sector agnostic. Having said that, for retail investors, we would suggest maintaining diversified portfolios through mutual funds as there may be certain sectors that would face structural, cyclical, regulatory or business model risks at the moment. For HNI investors we suggest focussing on investing in fundamentally good but under-valued stocks but only after detailed self-study or else with assistance from a domain expert, who will guide them through the various complex financial ratios as well as qualitative assessment of future earnings potential of the selected companies. Is it the time to stay away from smallcap and keep portfolio tilted towards mid-largecaps? The key always lies in maintaining your asset allocation based on individual risk profiles. In addition to this within equity, one should look at how much is the sub-asset allocation across largecaps, midcaps & smallcaps. Smallcap stocks have had an impressive run, but they also come with heightened risks, especially in volatile market conditions; one of the big ones being limited liquidity affecting price movements, despite good fundamentals. Given the current global geopolitical & economic uncertainties and possible sell-offs due to perceived high valuations, it might be prudent to tilt the portfolio towards mid and large-cap stocks, which generally offer more stability and are better equipped to navigate economic challenges. However, this doesnâ€™t mean completely avoiding small-caps. Selective exposure to quality smallcaps with strong growth prospects and solid financials can still add value to a portfolio, in the long run through multi-bagger returns. The key to investing in smallcaps is to balance risk and reward by focusing on fundamentals and staying bravely invested through short term market downturns, typically over a period of four to five years. Are you confident about the beginning of interest rate reduction cycle from next month onwards? While there has been speculation about a potential interest rate cut, I believe itâ€™s important to temper expectations, especially in India. Central banks across geographies, are likely to remain cautious, considering inflationary pressures and global economic uncertainties. A premature reduction in interest rates could undermine efforts to keep inflation in check. That said, in India, if inflation remains around RBIâ€™s target range of 4 percent & the tolerance band of an additional 2 percent and global geopolitical & economic conditions stabilize, we could see a gradual shift towards a more accommodative stance & a reducing interest rate cycle in India.

Maximum Call writing was seen at the 25,600 strike, which saw an addition of 16.28 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,300 and 25,500 strikes, which added 7.19 lakh and 3.84 lakh contracts, respectively.

The move comes as foreigners continue to add money into index-eligible bonds with August seeing net inflows of $2.8 billion, the most since JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced last year it would include Indian bonds to its flagship emerging market gauge. India now has a 3% weight on the index, which will be ramped up to 10%, the maximum possible by March 2025. Net flows to Indian bonds have picked up as the nationâ€™s weight in the emerging market index increases, while the end of election-related uncertainty and market expectations of a Fed rate cut next month are also helping, analysts including Nimish Prabhune and Min Dai at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note. If sovereign wealth funds and public retail funds that are otherwise exempted from making any additional disclosures, seek to register in India, the capital market regulator is considering if it can further ease their application process, Narayan said. In addition, the regulator has also created a dedicated cell for foreign portfolio investors, which has already reached out to over 500 investors, Narayan said. This cell will serve as a window to address any issues that may be faced by FPIs during registration, he said. â€śEnsuring ease of doing investments for FPIs to draw in good quality overseas savings remains a top priority for us,â€ť he said.

About 1,224 shares advanced while 1,208 shares declined on the NSE. Overall, the trend is expected to remain positive despite occasional consolidation. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at Samco Securities Ipca Laboratories| CMP: Rs 1,399.4  Ipca Laboratories has shown strong upward momentum after a brief consolidation. The previous resistance level has turned into support, and the stock is trading above its short-term DMAs (Day Moving Averages). The weekly chart further highlights the stock's strength. The positive performance of the pharma sector adds to the positive outlook for the stock. It can be accumulated in the Rs 1,370â€“1,400 zone. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,500 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,360 Aegis Logistics| CMP: Rs 836.35  Aegis Logistics has broken its declining trendline after establishing a strong base around the Rs 750 level, signaling upward momentum with robust volume participation. The stock is currently trading above its 20 and 50 DMAs. Notably, the previous day's delivery volume surged by 53.94 percent compared to the 5-day average, indicating growing investor interest. With the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) holding steady at 60, a move above Rs 845 could trigger strong traction on the higher side. Based on this technical structure, one can initiate a long position at the current market price (CMP) of Rs 836.35. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 910 Stop-Loss: Rs 790 Prism Johnson| CMP: Rs 175.7  Prism Johnson formed a strong bullish candle with higher volumes on the daily chart, indicating strong momentum. The formation of a triple bottom pattern and sustaining above the previous resistance of Rs 173 further highlights the sustained trend. The stock is trading above its 20 DMA, and a bullish crossover in the daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) further supports the positive outlook. One can initiate a long position at the current market price of Rs 175.7. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 195 Stop-Loss: Rs 165 Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors Chalet Hotels| CMP: Rs 876  Chalet Hotels witnessed a rally of more than 2 percent in the previous session despite muted market performance. Since August 21, not a single candle has closed below the previous dayâ€™s low. The stock is currently trading at the resistance of the trendline. A breakout above this resistance could result in a fresh rise. The stock has also broken out of the upper Bollinger Bands, which is a positive sign. However, follow-up buying is needed to confirm a bullish stance. The ADX (Average Directional Index) is currently trading above 25, around 30 levels, indicating that good momentum is expected to continue. In summary, the trend for Chalet Hotels is bullish. A breach above Rs 880 can lift the price higher towards Rs 960, provided Rs 840 remains protected on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 960 Stop-Loss: Rs 840 Titan Company| CMP: Rs 3,621  Titan has been closing above its previous high and has gained more than 2 percent in the last three days. The stock has been consolidating in a broader range since May, and a breakout is now expected. Prices are currently at an important resistance area near Rs 3,660. A decisive breakout above this level could result in fresh buying. In the previous session, prices were trading near the upper band of the Bollinger Band; a close above it would accelerate buying pressure. Additionally, the KST (Know Sure Thing) is trading above the zero line, suggesting good momentum is likely. In summary, Titan looks positive. A break above Rs 3,660 can lift prices towards Rs 3,960, as long as Rs 3,510 holds on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,960 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,510 Tilaknagar Industries| CMP: Rs 301.75  Tilaknagar Industries experienced a sharp rally of more than 6.70 percent in the previous session. The stock has formed a Cup and Handle pattern and closed above Rs 289, confirming the breakout of this pattern. The daily ADX suggests that strong momentum can continue, with a reading of 26.53, which is above 25. For now, a buy-on-dips approach is advisable. Use dips towards Rs 295â€“298 as a buying opportunity for a move towards Rs 330â€“335, as long as Rs 285 holds on the downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 330, Rs 335 Stop-Loss: Rs 285 Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities Oracle Financial Services Software| CMP: Rs 11,455  OFSS recently achieved a decisive breakout above the critical Rs 11,443 resistance level, signaling a strong bullish trend. The RSI (14) on the daily chart is positioned near 65, reflecting solid upward momentum. This technical configuration suggests that the stock is well-positioned for further gains in the near term. The stop-loss should be placed just below the recent support to manage risk effectively, offering an attractive risk-reward profile. With the current momentum, a target of Rs 12,000+ is both realistic and attainable.Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 12,000+ Stop-Loss: Rs 11,300 JK Cement| CMP: Rs 4,647.8  JK Cement confirmed a robust uptrend by breaking out above the pivotal Rs 4,600 level, reinforcing its bullish trajectory. The RSI (14) is nearing 68, underscoring strong momentum that supports further upward movement on the daily charts. This breakout, coupled with solid technical indicators, enhances the stock's potential for continued appreciation. The stop-loss should be set strategically below the breakout point to mitigate downside risks and ensure a favourable risk-reward balance. Given the strength of the momentum, the stock is expected to reach Rs 4,800+ in the near future. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 4,800+ Stop-Loss: Rs 4,555 Dixon Technologies India| CMP: Rs 12,991.8  Dixon has demonstrated a strong recovery from the significant support level at Rs 12,500, signaling renewed buying interest and potential for further upside. The RSI (14), currently around 58.87, indicates that the stock has regained positive momentum, which is crucial for sustaining an upward trajectory. The sharp rebound observed on the hourly charts further substantiates the bullish outlook. The stop-loss should be placed below the key support level to manage risk effectively. With these factors in play, a target of Rs 13,600 appears well within reach as the stock continues to gain momentum. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 13,600 Stop-Loss: Rs 12,450 Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company| CMP: Rs 1,500  Cholamandalam Finance recently broke out above the significant Rs 1,476 resistance level, marking the onset of a strong bullish phase. The RSI (14) on the daily charts is near 66, indicating sustained momentum and further upside potential. This technical breakout, combined with robust momentum indicators, positions the stock favourably for continued gains. The stop-loss should be carefully set just below recent support to ensure that risk is well-managed while maintaining a positive risk-reward ratio. With the current bullish sentiment, the stock is poised to reach Rs 1,625+ in the near term. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,625+ Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 ",2024-09-03 20:55

In the previous session, prices showed sideways action for yet another day. The index is consolidating at the higher end. For now, a breach below 25,180 would be a cause for concern! Overall, the trend remains positive as the Nifty protected the previous dayâ€™s low. One can continue to use a buy-on-dips approach to ride the trend with a target of 25,361 (Gann). Key Resistance: 25,650 (September Futures) Key Support: 25,180 (September Futures) Strategy: Long positions can be created on a break above 25,420 (September Futures) with a stop-loss at 25,340 and a target of 25,550, followed by 25,650 levels. Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives & Research at SAMCO Securities The remarkable winning streak for the last 14 trading sessions has happened for the first time in 30 years. September is historically a negative month for the Nifty; in six out of the last 10 years, September has closed on a negative note. Thus, we expect the Nifty to trade with a flat to negative bias in the near term. Key Resistance: 25,395, 25,500, 26,000 Key Support: 25,000, 24,800, 24,500 Strategy: Traders should employ a Call Ratio Spread strategy by buying 1 lot of the 25,300 strike Call with a September 12th expiry and selling two lots of the 25,400 strike Call. In case of a stop-loss, one should exit the trade if the total loss on the strategy exceeds Rs 2,000. On the target front, one can hold till expiry or book profits when the total profit on the position reaches Rs 3,500. Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities The Nifty has immediate support at 25,200 and major support at 25,000. The index is likely to move upwards towards the 25,500 and 25,600 levels, with potential to reach 26,000 eventually. The overall trend suggests buying on every dip. Key Resistance: 25,500, 25,600 Key Support: 25,200, 25,000 Strategy: Traders are advised to buy at the current market price (CMP) of 25,280, with a stop-loss at 25,200 for a target of 25,500 and 25,600. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors In the last session, the Bank Nifty finally closed above the previous dayâ€™s high, which is a positive sign. It has protected the previous dayâ€™s low on a closing basis since August 14. In summary, the overall trend for the Bank Nifty remains positive. Key Resistance: 52,100 (September Futures) Key Support: 51,300 (September Futures) Strategy: Long positions can be created above 51,900 (September Futures) with a target of 52,100 (September Futures), followed by 52,390 (September Futures), as long as 51,500 (September Futures) holds on the downside. Apurva Sheth, Head of Market Perspectives & Research at Samco Securities The Nifty Bank has underperformed the Nifty and several other indices. However, it seems that bulls are finally catching up. It broke out of the last monthâ€™s trading range on Tuesday and ended near the dayâ€™s high. It has closed above the resistance level of 51,500, indicating a firm hold by the bulls. Private sector banks are gaining momentum and may lead the rally in the Nifty Bank. The daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also gaining momentum. Key Resistance: 52,000, 53,000 Key Support: 51,500, 51,133 Strategy: Traders can execute a Bull Call Spread in the Nifty Bank by buying a 51,800 strike Call and selling a 52,500 strike Call for the September 11 expiry. One should place a stop-loss at Rs 3,300. On the target front, one can book profits once the index trades at 52,500 levels or when the total profit on the strategy exceeds Rs 6,000. Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities The Bank Nifty has shown a strong breakout above the 51,500 mark, indicating targets of 52,000 and 52,500. Traders should buy on every dip and consider buying at the current market price (CMP) for a substantial upside move. Strong charts and buying momentum in banking stocks are driving this bullish trend. Immediate support is at 51,400, with major support at 51,000, making these levels crucial for maintaining the upward trajectory. Key Resistance: 52,000, 52,200 Key Support: 51,400, 51,000 Strategy: Buy the Bank Nifty at CMP of 51,689, with a stop-loss of 51,400 and a target of 52,000 and 52,500. ",2024-09-03 20:01

The news of more crude supply possibly returning to the market came as prices had already fallen on the belief that demand was being undercut because of sluggish economic growth in China, the world's biggest crude importer. Brent crude futures were down $3.08, or 4%, to $74.44 a barrel at 1333 GMT, the lowest level since December. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, which did not settle on Monday because of the U.S. Labour Day holiday, were down $2.55, or 3.5%, at $71.00 - their lowest since January. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said the sell-off was tied to Bloomberg's report, which quoted the Libyan central banker at the centre of the controversy as saying there were ""strong"" indications that the political factions involved were nearing an agreement. Libyan oil exports at major ports were halted on Monday and production curtailed across the country, six engineers told Reuters, continuing a standoff between rival political factions over control of the central bank and oil revenue. Libya's National Oil Corp (NOC) declared force majeure on its El Feel oilfield from Sept. 2. Total production had plunged to little more than 591,000 barrels per day (bpd) as of Aug. 28 from nearly 959,000 bpd on Aug. 26, NOC said. Production was at about 1.28 million bpd on July 20, the company said. The Libya news compounded an earlier fall in prices tied to weak Chinese economic data. ""The weaker than expected Chinese manufacturing PMI over the weekend likely exacerbated concerns about the Chinese economy's performance,"" said Charalampos Pissouros, senior investment analyst at brokerage XM On Monday China reported new export orders fell for first time in eight months in July and that prices of new homes rose in August at their weakest pace this year. Some supply is set to return to the market as eight members of OPEC and affiliates, together known as OPEC+, are scheduled to boost output by 180,000 bpd in October. The plan is likely to go ahead regardless of demand worries, industry sources said. ""It remains to be seen how low prices can go before OPEC+ reacts, as most cartel members need prices above current levels to come close to balancingbudgets,"" said Panmure Liberum analyst Ashley Kelty. Disruptions to supply flows from the Middle East after two oil tankers were attacked on Monday in the Red Sea off Yemen were not enough to buoy prices. The tankers did not sustain major damage.

Now, a slump in Intel's share price could cost the American chipmaker its place in the blue-chip index. Analysts and investors said Intel was likely to be removed from the Dow, pointing to a near 60% decline in the company's shares this year that has made it the worst performer on the index and left it with the lowest stock price on the price-weighted Dow. A removal will hurt Intel's already bruised reputation. The company has missed out on the artificial intelligence boom after passing on an OpenAI investment and losses are mounting at the contract manufacturing unit that the chipmaker has been building out in hopes of challenging TSMC. To fund a turnaround, Intel suspended dividend and announced layoffs affecting 15% of its workforce during its earnings report last month. But some analysts and a former board member believe the moves might be too little, too late for the chipmaker. ""Intel being removed was likely a long time coming,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at the Carson Group. The latest results may be the final push needed to finally see the company removed from the Dow, Detrick added. S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the Dow, declined to comment on whether Intel could be removed from the index. Changes to the index are made as needed and the last update happened in February when struggling pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance was replaced by Amazon.com. Stock price is a key element for inclusion in the Dow, unlike the S&P 500 index which takes into account market value. The Dow's selection committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest. Currently, the highest weighted stock â€“ UnitedHealth Group â€“ is priced about 29 times higher than Intel. The chipmaker is also the least influential member of the index with a meager 0.32% weightage based on its closing price of $20.13 on Aug. 29. While the larger impact would be to Intel's reputation, the exclusion would further hit its shares, which are down more than 70% from a record high in August 2000, leaving the chipmaker with a market value below $100 billion for the first time in 30 years. Intel's shares were down 3.6% to $21.25 on Tuesday. WHO WOULD REPLACE INTEL? Nvidia could replace Intel on the Dow, according to Ryuta Makino, research analyst at Intel investor Gabelli Funds. With shares up more than 160% this year, Nvidia has become one of the world's most valuable firms thanks to the essential role its chips play in powering generative AI. A stock split in May also increased the odds of its inclusion. But some investors said Nvidia might be too volatile a stock for the Dow, which usually prefers more stable stocks. Texas Instruments, a nearly century-old chipmaker with significant production capacity within the United States, is another option to replace Intel in the index, said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which owns shares in Intel. Texas Instruments' shares have risen more than 20% this year to $211.09 as of Thursday, which is closer to the Dow constituents' average price of about $209. In the event of a removal, a stock with a price closer to the average price of the current list might be preferred as a replacement, said David Blitzer, who chaired the S&P Dow Jones Indices' Index Committee for more than two decades until 2019.

After this only, the FPI would be in a position to draw out funds,â€ť said Narayan. Narayan said that all this process could be done on T+1 itself. He, however, said that there has been some noise in the market that settling funds on T+1 will lead to an increase in custodian charges. Narayan further added that when remittance of funds was delayed, it led to a huge opportunity loss for FPIs.

TheÂPSU index'smarket capitalization share has retreated from its May peak of 16.24 percent. Such has been the surge in PSU stocks that the share of the index has stayed in double digits since December 2022. Off 52-Week Highs The BSE PSU Index consists of 59 stocks, with 26 of those falling between 20-37 percent, 18 declining 10-19 percent, and 14 dropping 1-10 percent in August. OnlyHindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL)has been trading atÂ its 52-week high. The BSE PSU Index has declined by four percent since testing its 52-week high, while the benchmark Sensex is at fresh highs.  Analysts said this recent decline follows a significant rally earlier in the year thatÂ was fuelled by positive sentiment around increased public spend, reforms, and privatisation efforts. Investors were hopeful of performance improvements in PSUs, boosted by strong earnings in sectors like energy and defence. PSUs were perceived as under-valued compared to their private sector peers, making them attractive bets inÂ the rally, said analysts. Siddarth Bhamre, Head of Research at Asit C Mehta Investment Intermediates, explained that the rally in PSU stocks since last year was driven by expectations of strong earnings, but recent earnings have not met these expectations. Earnings across PSU sectors, such as banks, capital goods, and metals, has been underwhelming, relative to the sharp rise in share prices since last year, prompting a correction. Disappointing PSU earnings are the main reason for the correction, said Bhamre, even as overall market reached new highs. In terms of valuations, PSUs are still at relatively higher levels compared to their prices before June, making them less attractive for bargain hunting, as yet. Bhamre added that apart from SBI, no major PSU currently offers compelling valuation or earnings potential. Among the biggest losers,Cochin Shipyarddropped 37 percent from its 52-week high, followed byBEMLandMRPL, each down over 30 percent. Other major PSU stocks like Union Bank of India, KIOCL, UCO Bank, and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders have fallen around 28 percent each. Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom said the recent decline can be attributed to profit-taking by investors after a sharp rise. A broader market correction driven by global uncertainties and a rising rate scenario has added to the pullback, along with the fact that many PSUs have reached valuations considered as fair or fully valued. With these stocks no longer seeming like bargains, the momentum has slowed, leading to a reduction in their market share. Kranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, noted that before general elections, there was significant excitement & euphoria around PSU companies, fuelling a rally beyond valuations in many cases. After theÂ elections, these stocks are seeing consolidation and profit booking. There could be selective buying opportunities going forward in stocks like HAL, SBI, LIC, Coal India, and ONGC etc. Some pockets of railway and defence too may offer value, due to their strong order book and earnings visibility.

Akriti Mehrotra, Research Analyst at StoxBox expects the issue to list at a premium of 45 percent over its upper price band. ""As the industry embraces digital solutions, ECOS is well-positioned to leverage its operational excellence and advanced technology for continued growth and leadership.

The company has a fleet of more than 9,000 vehicles from economy to luxury cars. It also provides speciality vehicles like luggage vans, limousines, vintage cars and vehicles for accessible transportation for people with disabilities. Prashanth Tapse, Sr VP Research â€“ Research Analyst at Mehta Equities Ltd expects the issue to generate decent listing gains over and above 20 percent on the issue price on the back of market optimism. After listing on the valuation front, it can move from reasonable value to stretched valuations, which would be reason for profit booking attempts at high levels, he added. According to multiple websites that track the grey market premium activities, the shares of ECOS Mobility are commanding a GMP in the price range of Rs 160 in the unregulated market. Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd, reiterated the same stating that the IPO garnered significant investor interest, evidenced by a robust subscription rate of 64.18 times and a substantial grey market premium (GMP) of Rs 160 (47.90 percent). She added that given the mixed financial performance and elevated valuation, investors may want to adopt a wait-and-watch approach for the long term. However, strong market demand for the IPO, as reflected in the subscription rate and GMP, suggests potential for a positive listing. ",2024-09-03 17:01

Brent crude futures fell by $1.65, or 2.1%, to $75.87 a barrel by 1004 GMT. West Texas Intermediate crude futures, which did not settle on Monday because of the U.S. Labour Day holiday, were down $1.06, or 1.4%, at $72.49. ""The weaker than expected Chinese manufacturing PMI over the weekend likely exacerbated concerns about the Chinese economy's performance,"" said Charalampos Pissouros, senior investment analyst at brokerage XM ""The Libya and Middle East stories are keeping a floor below prices, leaving the door open to a further recovery in the foreseeable future."" On Monday China reported new export orders fell for first time in eight months in July and that prices of new homes rose in August at their weakest pace this year. In Libya, oil exports at major ports were halted on Monday and production curtailed across the country, six engineers told Reuters, continuing a standoff between rival political factions over control of the central bank and oil revenue. So far there is limited upside support from large production disruptions in Libya, owing to the uncertainty over how long those outages might last, said UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo. Libya's National Oil Corp (NOC) declared force majeure on its El Feel oilfield from Sept. 2. Total production had plunged to little more than 591,000 barrels per day (bpd) as of Aug. 28 from nearly 959,000 bpd on Aug. 26, NOC said. Production was at about 1.28 million bpd on July 20, the company said. Some supply is set to return to the market as eight members of OPEC and affiliates, together known as OPEC+, are scheduled to boost output by 180,000 bpd in October. The plan is likely to go ahead regardless of demand worries, industry sources said. ""It remains to be seen how low prices can go before OPEC+ reacts, as most cartel members need prices above current levels to come close to balancingbudgets,"" said Panmure Liberum analyst Ashley Kelty. Continuing disruptions to supply flows from the Middle East are also supporting the market. Two oil tankers were attacked on Monday in the Red Sea off Yemen but did not sustain major damage.

He further pointed out the uncertainty about the future, especially with respect to market timing. â€śIs it six months away? One year away? That's what the market is thinking,â€ť he said, adding that the influx of equity into the market is a revolutionary change. â€śThe revolutionary injection of equity, once in a lifetime after 75 years, into the corporate world, is going to have a tremendous impact,â€ť he said while suggesting that this resilience in the economy and the market will result in a different level of confidence among entrepreneurs. However, despite this equity surge, demand remains a challenge. â€śThe real problem is the demand,â€ť he said, highlighting that companies, particularly in the auto industry, are cautious about adjusting production levels based on changes in demand. Given this backdrop, Agrawal said that the task of identifying successful stocks is challenging especially when seen in the context of stock market strategies. â€śIt is very tough to find those stocks that are supported by all kinds of sellers,â€ť he said. A Large Portion of the Market Remains Undervalued Navin Agarwal, Group Managing Director at MOFSL, highlighted that a significant portion of the market remains undervalued. â€śSeventy to seventy-five percent of the market (large caps) is reasonably valued. In fact, it is cheaply valued compared to its past. So, you are not worried about that,â€ť he said. He further explained that while dividing the market into large, mid, and small caps, there is some froth in the small caps. The mid-cap segment shows mixed results: some companies are experiencing strong growth, while others are not performing as well. Given this variability, Agarwal said that about 12 percent of the market is significantly overvalued. â€śThis is not unusual, as 10 to 12 percent of markets worldwide are also highly overvalued, if not more,â€ť he added. While small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) stocks are very overvalued, it is not a concern for mutual funds, as these funds typically do not invest in SMEs. â€śThere will always be pockets of undervaluation and overvaluation,â€ť he concluded.

moneycontrol.com,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/wall-street-strategists-face-their-own-short-squeeze-12813568.html,Wall Street strategists face their own short squeeze,The marketâ€™s supporting cast looks to be hitting its stride..Related stories.,"Since the pandemic, Wall Street strategists have repeatedly underestimated the performance of the US stock market in their annual projections, leading to a mad dash to boost their outlooks inÂ the back end of the year. The flurry of upward revisions can look something like a â€śshort squeeze,â€ť which is a situation where traders are forced to cover bearish bets in quick succession, often reinforcingÂ a securityâ€™s upward momentum. In that sense, this year has already seen the biggest short squeeze among strategists in a decade, and seasonal trends suggest itâ€™s poised to continue in coming months. In general, such price targets have always had a spotty record, but this market has proved particularly difficult for strategists to process. First, the outperformance of large-cap growth companies has broken traditional models meant to translate macroeconomic conditions and interest rates into fair values for the S&P 500 Index. Just five companies â€” Nvidia Corp, Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc â€” explain almostÂ half the benchmarkâ€™s performance since early 2020, which means that macro models are insufficient if they fail to account for their idiosyncratic stories, including the artificial intelligence theme. Though some stocks have benefitted from rising price-earnings multiples, itâ€™s mostly been the underlying surge in revenues and profits that have powered them higher. At a minimum, every strategist should be having lunch with aÂ Nvidia analyst a few times a quarter. Second, economists and strategists have consistently misjudged the strength of the economy. At the start of 2023, the median estimate showed economists surveyed by Bloomberg thought the US would barely muddle through the year. Instead, it grew 2.5% and looks poised to do so again this year. Much of the forecast error was probably an over-reliance on old rules of thumb, including the idea that Federal Reserve interest-rate increasesÂ typically lead to economic downturns. That may be true in â€śnormalâ€ť economic cycles, but not after a pandemic when employers are hoarding labor, consumers are desperate to get back into restaurants and concerts and the typical homeowner has a 3% mortgage rate and is swimming in home equity. Economists may have also underestimated the macroeconomic impacts of capital expenditures from the AIÂ arms race along withÂ President Joe Bidenâ€™s industrial policies. And yet the average strategist surveyed by Bloomberg still sees the S&P 500, which closed last week atÂ 5,648,Â falling about 3% to end the year at 5,469 (median: 5,600; range: 4,200-6,000). Thatâ€™s perplexingÂ because many pieces of that 2023-2024 story remain broadly intact, supported by real-time data. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantaâ€™s GDPNow model suggests the economy is currently growing at a 2.5% annualized rate. About 81% of S&P 500 companies have beaten Wall Street estimates in the current earnings season, including consumer bellwethers Target Corp and Walmart Inc. And longer-term borrowing costs have begun to plummet in advance of expected FedÂ rate cuts likely to begin in September. Initial jobless claims show layoffs arenâ€™t getting out of hand, and the recent slump in AI chipmaker Nvidia (known to some asÂthe most important stock on the planet) has been more about company-specific production snags, rather than the long-term promise of AI. Meanwhile, the marketâ€™s supporting cast looks to beÂ hitting its stride. Excluding the top five stocks, earnings growth for members of the S&P 500 is projected to accelerate through 2025. Of course, the S&P 500 is trading at 21.3Â times blended forward earning, which is on the high side of history. That shouldnâ€™t be handwaved away even if itâ€™s largely a reflection of the indexâ€™s changing composition. Yet high valuations reinforced by fundamentals and great stories can stay high for sustained periods of time. And with another strategist short squeeze seemingly in the offing this autumn and winter, itâ€™s much harder to imagine that a reckoning is close at hand. Credit: BloombergÂ ",2024-09-03 16:45

Investors need to be 'far more aware' of the investing landscape, and should be doing more due diligence, Shenoy said, adding that people must read disclosures and cannot bet purely based on the Gray Market Premium (GMP) of the public issues alone. ""The guardrails should be about the investors understanding the companies."" Shenoy also added that regulations need to support more and frequent disclosures from the SMEs looking to tap the IPO route. Promoters should be fined for poor disclosures, Shenoy suggested. On the frenzied interest in IPOs, Shenoy said, ""Its a procedural problem, as this is was the SME system was designed for"", implying the SME IPO exchange was designed for smaller enterprises to find ways to raise growth capital, and not a platform for outsized bids for public issues. Market regulator Sebi's whole-time member Ashwini Bhatia hadhinted at the need for cautionin this space, speaking at an event on September 2. ""Nobody is actually saying no. I am a banker, and we were taught to say no when necessary."" Bhatia added that unfortunately, this rigorous approach is sometimes lacking in the current (SME) ecosystem, including among chartered accountants, merchant bankers, and exchanges. The regulator is now planning to soon come out with a consultation paper on the listing process in the SME space. Currently, the approval process for the SME IPOs rests with stocks exchanges, which have to do the due diligence and seek disclosures for the applicants. Deepak Shenoy hoped that the exchanges do not tighten too much or seek SMEs to put forth greater Free Cash Flow. ""A lot of companies in general do not generate FCF, as they need to re-invest substantially in capex. So, it may not be right for the SME market to demand that."" The market regulator had shared asurveyon September 2, which suggested individual investors in IPOs sold shares within a week of listing, in cases where there were gains to be made. This rush for public issues also stems from a trend of rise in demat accounts that were created after Covid-19. ""Many investors are putting money into IPOs just with the intention to make a quick buck,â€ťBloombergquoted Vineet Arora of NAV Capital Emerging Star Fund. The buoyant demand for public issues has seen a very strong interest from the retail segment of the market. Veteran market investor Vijay Kedia too is finding the SME space frothy, and has said that he is not ready to invest in such a market for IPOs or pre-IPOs, preferring the comfort of his earlier investments. ""In this kind of market, I will not invest. I am just sticking to my old investments, and I am comfortable. When there is a typhoon, the best thing would be to stay calm,"" Kedia told CNBC-TV18 during a conversation on September 2, referring to the frenzy in the unlisted or SME space and the pre-IPO placement. ""This is clear euphoria, and I would like to stay away,"" he added, in response to a question regarding the unlisted space and the rush for public issues.

On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has been inching higher steadily helped by sector rotation. We shall continue to ride the upmove. On the upside we expect Nifty to target levels of 25500. On the downside the crucial support base is placed at 25160 â€“ 25120 where the key hourly moving averages are placed. We shall continue to ride the upmove with a trailing stoploss mechanism. The Bank Nifty has finally showed some spark and is now inching higher towards 51950 - 52000 zone which coincides with the 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level. The support base shifts higher towards 51300 â€“ 51200 from short term perspective. Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivatives, Angel One The Indian equity markets started the session on a flat note with the benchmark index struggling to continue its positive stature. Led by a narrow range-bound move, the Nifty50 index managed to extend its winning streak but only by a whisker. The index settled the session just one point higher at 25280. From a technical standpoint, the market levels have seen little alteration, with the Nifty index fluctuating within a narrow range of about 90 points without a clear trend. Additionally, the market breadth suggests a strong tug of war between the Bulls and Bears. Looking ahead, 25200 is poised to act as a key support for the benchmark, while a solid support zone is expected within the 25100-25000 range. On the higher end of the spectrum, 25350-25400 is anticipated to act as intermediate resistance, followed by the sturdy hurdle of 25500 in the comparable period. Looking ahead, it is crucial to monitor the recent movement in the high beta index BankNifty, as any potential increase in buying activity following a prolonged consolidation phase could inject the necessary momentum into the markets. Nonetheless, given the apparent fatigue in the benchmark index, it's essential to adopt a pragmatic approach. ",2024-09-03 15:55

SEBI is examining an alleged regulatory violation involving the inter-se transfer of investments held by Hexa Securities and Finance Co., in which several Jindal family members, including JSW Group chairman Sajjan Jindal, were holding director positions, the people said, requesting anonymity. The IPO approval process of thecement-making arm of the JSW Groupmay remain on hold till a settlement application, filed by Sajjan Jindal and other members of the Jindal family in response to the show cause notice, is resolved by the regulator, people cited above added. One of the people cited above said that JSW Cement could have waited for a resolution and then filed the share sale documents with Sebi or do both in parallel, adding that the company chose to go ahead with the second option. Sebi puts share sale offer documents on hold when there are pending proceedings against the company or its promoter. Moneycontrol could not ascertain when the alleged transfer of investments occurred. The transfer came under regulatory scrutiny when Hexa Securitiesâ€™ parent, Hexa Tradex Ltd (HTL), filed for voluntary delisting, and some shareholders complained to Sebi about the terms of the delisting. An email sent to the JSW group spokesperson did not elicit a response till the time of publication. SEBI did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. According to its policy stated on its website, the regulator does not disclose reasons for delaying IPO approvals. This article will be updated if a response is received later. According to the draft offer document of JSW Cement, a show cause notice dated March 18, 2024, was issued to Hexa Tradex, a member of JSW Cementâ€™s promoter group, and its directors as well as Sajjan Jindal, and certain other members of the Jindal family, including Prithvi Raj Jindal, Naveen Jindal and Ratan Jindal. â€śSuch show cause notice was issued for transactions involving Hexa Tradex, including the transfer of investments held by Hexa Securities and Finance Co. Ltd (a subsidiary of Hexa Tradex) to certain Promoter Group entities, for the purpose of realignment and reorganisation within the group. One of our Promoters, Sajjan Jindal and Prithvi Raj Jindal, a member of our Promoter Group on account of being a director on the board of HTL have been named in the show cause notice for allegedly aiding and facilitating such transactions and violating, among others, the provisions of the SEBI Act, 1992, and the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices relating to Securities Market) Regulations, 2003,â€ť the JSW Cement DRHP noted. Sajjan Jindal and certain members of the promoter group have submitted their replies dated June 24 to SEBI, contesting the show cause notice, and they have also filed settlement applications dated May 16 to bring an â€śexpeditious closureâ€ť to the matter. â€śWhile the matter is currently pending with SEBI, any unfavourable outcome could adversely impact our reputation or ability to undertake capital market transactions,â€ť the DRHP noted.

There is another matter in which the regulatory watchdog and the bank are connected and, interestingly, it has also seen its fair share of controversy with SEBIâ€™s action being questioned in the courts as well. The matter is related to the merger of ICICI Securities â€“ which she headed for two years â€“ with ICICI Bank and SEBI giving a controversial exemption to ease the merger process for the bank where she has worked for more than a decade. So, whatâ€™s the big deal about ICICI Bank's plans to merge with its affiliate ICICI Securities, and why is SEBI receiving flak for it? We break it down for you in this edition of MC Explains: What's the fuss about ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities merger? ICICI Bank, which owns around 75 percent of ICICI Securities, announced plans to acquire the remaining ownership in the brokerage in June last year, offering 67 shares of the bank for every 100 shares of the affiliate. Typically, when a listed company is bought out and subsequently delisted from stock exchanges, the regulatorâ€™s guidelines require a bidding process to determine the fair price. However, there is one exemption, specified in the market regulator's 2021 rules, which ICICI Bank chose to use for its transaction â€“ it sought SEBIâ€™s approval and the watchdog gave it.Interestingly, this exemption allows companies to bypass the price discovery process but can be used only if the target company is a subsidiary of the acquirer but, more importantly, both entities should operate in the same line of business. In such cases, shareholders of both companies are informed of the share swap ratio and asked to vote on the proposal instead of going through the lengthy bidding process. But are ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities in the same line of business? ICICI Bank is a lender, while ICICI Securities is a brokerage firm, which clearly means they operate in different lines of business. Despite this, ICICI Bank requested an exemption from the market regulator, which it received last June, allowing it to conduct a vote for the merger. SEBI's approval for an exemption was the first red flag raised by minority shareholders, who questioned the decision to bypass the price discovery process, arguing it contradicted the market regulator's own guidelines. Additionally, SEBI chiefâ€™s previous connection with ICICI Securities â€“ she has served as the chief executive of the brokerage firm before joining SEBI -- came under scrutiny. To be fair, Buch recused herself from any proceedings involving ICICI Bank to avoid any conflict of interest scenario. However, questions have still been raised about the validity of the exemption and those remain unanswered till date. Why was there further controversy around the vote for the merger? The tale doesn't end here. While minority investors were already irked with SEBI giving its approval for the exemption that, in turn, helped the bank bypass the price process discovery for shareholders of ICICI Securities, more concerns were raised over how the merger vote was handled. Althoughthe merger was approved in March this yearwith 72 percent of shareholders voting in favour, the process faced criticism due to ICICI Securities sharing the personal data of its minority investors with ICICI Bank. Thereafter, bank employees reached out to these investors, claiming the purpose was to explain the transaction andencourage participation in e-voting. How did SEBI tackle the concerns? SEBI deemed this data sharing â€śinappropriate,â€ť pointing out that the bank had aâ€śclear conflict of interestâ€ť given its stake in the outcome.But, it merely issued an administrative warning to both the acquirer and the target. Not surprising, minority shareholders considered the market regulator's response to the privacy breach as 'lenient'. What happened next? An unprecedented event in the Indian equity market followed: over 100 public, non-institutional investors of ICICI Securities joined hands to file a class-action lawsuit challenging the merger. Led by Bengaluru-based fund manager Manu Rishi Guptha, the contingent of shareholders contended that an unfair swap ratio had cost their group of investors over $200 million. In the midst of a booming bull market, Guptha claimed that the bank was taking advantage of the brokerageâ€™s Rs 11,600 crore ($1.4 billion) reserve of cash and short-term investments at a bargain, at the cost of minority shareholders. In their defence, both ICICI Securities and ICICI Bank clarified that the merger terms were determined by independent valuation experts, and the pricing was deemed fair by several proxy advisory firms as well. Did it manage to assuage the concerns of the minority shareholders? Embroiled in a legal battle, the merger of ICICI Bank and ICICI Securities has become a daily soap for investors. This has sparked high volatility in shares of ICICI Securities, which have seen erratic movements in recent months as investors bet on varying outcomes of the case.But more importantly, the entire fiasco has cast doubts on the market regulator's fair treatment of M&As within the securities market. Adding fuel to the fire, concerns have been raised over Buch's prior association with the firm. On Monday, a Congress spokesperson alleged that Buch received an income of Rs 16.80 crore from ICICI Bank between 2017 and 2024, even after she assumed the role of a whole-time member of the market regulator in 2017, further complicating the situation. The situation grows even murkier when considering the still-unanswered questions about why the market regulator allegedly went against its own rules to give an exemption to ICICI Bank, worsening the matter. To clear things up, the Bombay High Court directed SEBI to share its June 2023 approval letter with the advocate of Aruna Modi, a shareholder of the brokerage firm who has contested the exemption. However, the letter's contents will remain confidential until the court decides otherwise. Regardless, it will serve a key purpose: creating a framework for similar transactions in the future. Can any large company secure a regulatory waiver to absorb its listed subsidiary? What would define â€śsimilar line of businessesâ€ť? That is an important question that currently looms large, awaiting resolution. ",2024-09-03 14:49

After evaluating the plans outlined at RILâ€™s 47th annual general meeting, brokerages have maintained a positive outlook on Indiaâ€™s largest conglomerate, assigning new valuations to each segment.Â Hereâ€™s how they determined their target prices. Motilal Oswal  Reliance RetailÂ has been valued at Rs 1,797 per share by Motilal Oswal. Since Reliance Industries holds 87.9 percentÂ of Reliance retail, its value in RIL's share price comes to Rs 1,579 per share. ""Our premium valuation multiples capture the opportunity for a rapid expansion in its retail business and the aggressive rollout of digital platforms,"" said the brokerage. After factoring in the various stake sales in Reliance Jio, Motilal Oswal arrived at a price of Rs 940 per share for Jio. The higher multiple captures Reliance Jio'sÂ market leadership and market share gains, growth in the wireline (JioFiber and JioAirFiber) business, and its recently announced AI-based opportunities. These valuations combined led to a total target price of RsÂ 3,669 per share. However, the brokerage valued Reliance Industries' debt, which is largely capex-driven, at Rs 234 per share. When this is removed from the base target price, Motilal Oswal is left with a final fair value target of Rs 3,435 per share. Kotak Institutional Equities  Kotak Institutional Equities gave the energy arm a valuation of Rs 920 per share, of which, New Energy contributes Rs 103. The brokerage has given Reliance Industries' Disney-Viacom JV a valuation of around Rs 50/51 per share. Overall, Kotak Institutional Equities sees Reliance Industries' fair value rating at Rs 3,200 per share. ""We are optimistic on the earnings outlook and estimate ~13 percentÂ earnings CAGR over FY24-27,"" it said. JM Financial  JM Financial has valued Reliance Industries' digital business, including its telecom arm, at Rs 1,249 per share, with Jio contributing Rs 1,107 of that value. The brokerageÂ assessed RIL's New Energy arm at Rs 1.12 lakh crore, which is 1.5 times the announced capital expenditure of Rs 75,000 crore, translating to Rs 166 per share. ""We believe Reliance Industries' peak capex/net-debt is behind it, and also because the company has industry-leading capabilities across businesses to drive robust 16-17 percent EPS CAGR over the next 3-5 years,"" said the brokerage. Emkay Global  According to Emkay Global, after adjusting for net debt, the equity value per share is Rs 3,335. The organized retail segment contributes the highest value per share at Rs 1,302, followed by the telecom segment or Reliance Jio at Rs 1,004. Based on its sum of the parts (SoTP) analysis, Emkay sees RIL's price-to earnings (PE) ratio at 24.8x by September 2026. ""We retain our estimates and target price, though there is upside risk to the tune of 15-20 percent in valuation, based on the AGM commentary if execution is flawless, and timelines are met,"" wrote Emkay Global.

RailTel, Gulf Oil, Globus Spirits in focus","An IPO situation more closely approximates a negotiated deal. The seller decides when to come to market, and they donâ€™t pick a time thatâ€™s necessarily good for you - Warren Buffett.Related stories.","Indian markets are sporting lofty valuations despite subdued earnings growth. Amid this, the Indian IPO market has witnessed a notable upswing, driven by strong market sentiment. Retail investors are turning to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) as a potential goldmine. Not just domestic investors but even FIIs are more enthusiastic about IPOs as a Societe Generale (SG) report revealed that foreigners acquired more than $6 billion of stocks on the primary market this year, the highest since 2021. Going by the raging returns delivered by SME IPOs thus far, would make anyone believe that '21 din me paisa double' is no fraud scheme. Notably, the BSE SME IPO index has surged 136% this year, vastly outpacing the Sensexâ€™s 14% gain. If the outsized returns on some stocks are feeding the frenzy, the magic of IPOs is also being actively fuelled by hype, social media buzz, paid promos by influencers and association with high-profile investors, be it prominent market names or even social celebrities like Virat Kohli, Shilpa Shetty whose presence create an illusion of credibility to IPOs. Promoter equity offloads, once viewed as red flags, are now overlooked as investors chase after the latest hot issue. A tantalizing grey market premium (GMP) further ignites FOMO, leading to oversubscription, even when cash flow considerations are ignored. The IPO of Resourceful Automobile, which runs a modest operation with just two Yamaha showrooms and eight employees, attracted bids worth nearly Rs 5,000 croreâ€”420 times its Rs 12 crore target, despite its relatively small scale and past financial losses. Itâ€™s not an exception. Other IPOs from firms burdened with debt or lacking a standout outlook have also received enthusiastic responses. The situation is concerning if you look at the response from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) which has issued warnings about misleading MSME IPO promotions. The market regulator is concerned that some promoters are painting an overly optimistic picture to entice investors. For those still tempted to dive into the next IPO, remember Warren Buffettâ€™s sage advice: â€śAn IPO situation more closely approximates a negotiated deal. The seller decides when to come to market, and they donâ€™t pick a time thatâ€™s necessarily good for you.â€ť Gulf Oil Lubricants India ( Rs 1,479.75, +4.52%) Shares rose after Systematix initiated coverage and assigned a target price of Rs 1,700. Bear Case: The lubricant industry is flush with competition, which could have a bearing on the companyâ€™s market share, rendering prices competitive. Bull Case: Its market share in the lubricants segment is expected to grow consistently, supported by the companyâ€™s strategic entry into the electric vehicle (EV) segment and DC cooling liquids. These initiatives are seen as key drivers for long-term growth. RailTel (Rs 497.95, +1.46%) Bagged the 'Navratna' PSU status. Bull Case: More than a status symbol, PSUs with the Navratna tag can invest up to Rs 1,000 crore without prior government approval. Navratna PSUs also can allocate around 15 percent to a specific project or 30 percent of their net worth over an entire year, as long as it is under the Rs 1,000 crore limit, which bodes well Bear Case: Railtel's order book is more skewed towards non-railway projects, while its railway-related projects only make up 22 percent of the total order book. Additionally, the firm said Q1FY25 projects executed largely had low margins. If the firm continues to bag projects with low margins, it could have a serious impact on the bottomline. LG Balakrishnan & Bros (Rs 1,494, +8.4%) Shares hit 52-week high on heavy volumes Bull Case: HDFC Securities remained bullish on the medium-term prospects of the company due to strong domestic and export demand. The company's entry into industrial chains and RSAL Steel Pvt Ltd takeover completion create a positive outlook amongst analysts. It plans to raise funds through preferential allotment in Q2 with the promoter aiming to increase their stake to 39-40 percent. Bear Case: Increase in insurance costs and shipping challenges in European exports due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Competitive pressure in the US subsidiary has resulted in higher operating expenses. Stiff competition and volatility in commodity prices may cause profit margins to fluctuate. Globus Spirits (Rs 1,114 | +3.8%) Motilal Oswal MF buys stake Bull case: Globus Spirits shows strong growth with revenues over Rs 3,000 crore and consistent operating margins above 20 percent. The company's turnaround in its IMFL segment boosts its profitability prospects further. Bear case: Declining operating margins below 12 percent could hurt profitability. Project delays, rising costs, unexpected debt, or adverse regulatory changes could weaken Globus Spirits' financial stability and capital structure.

Purnartha remains focused on capital goods & consumer discretionary such as wires and cables and pipes, telecommunication, and energy, says the Co-Fund Manager of Purnartha. Chartered Accountant Riya with more than 12 years of experience in the financial industry, who looks at PMS and AIF at Purnartha feels largecaps offer valuation comfort along with reasonable earnings growth, but the high multiple of mid and small caps create discomfort. Are you still bullish on auto space? In Q1FY2025, the automotive sector experienced slower sales and high dealer inventory levels. However, sales typically improve during the festival season in Q2 and Q3. Companies are hopeful for a recovery, supported by favourable monsoon conditions and increased crop revenues. We think 2-wheeler will do relatively better than commercial vehicle and passenger vehicles. Are you sure about the 25bps cut in fed funds rate in the September policy meeting? Given the current situation, steep rate cuts are unlikely. Although unemployment has slowed, it should not provoke significant concern. The Fed is actively considering rate cuts in the future if unemployment data & inflation remains on expected trajectory becomes. If the Fed delivers the same, then will RBI follow the path in October? During the current interest rate cycle, India has raised its rates from 4 percent to 6.5 percent, while the US Federal Reserve has increased its rates from zero percent to 5.25-5.5 percent since 2022. This illustrates that although the Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s decisions may align directionally with the US Fedâ€™s, the magnitude of the rate changes differs. Also, the decisions of RBI would depend on the inflation which would entail more on food inflation, which has not eased since the rate hike cycle from May 2022. So, RBI might act in same direction but with delay and lesser cuts. Given the consistent run quarter after quarter, do you see the market ending the calendar with 15-20 percent gains? What are the triggers to watch? Difficult to comment on market movement, largecaps offer valuation comfort along with reasonable earnings growth. The high multiple of mid and small caps create discomfort but earnings growth excluding the current quarter has been higher. We need to be watchful of the changing trend, so we currently think it is better to place ourselves in largecaps where liquidity is higher and switch in case of an opportunity. The key trigger to watch out for going forward margin expansion and demand through volume growth in this period of corporate profitability which would see a few hiccups going forward. Where do you put your money amongst sectors? We remain focused on capital goods & consumer discretionary such as wires and cables and pipes, telecommunication, and energy as our invested strategy. For themes to play out, sectorally, we are watching out bottom-up approach which would include companies within a sector being witnessing margin expansion, or demand growth or valuation comfort. So, wherever we find 2 out of the three drivers within a sector, we would evaluate the opportunity in depth. ",2024-09-03 07:08

The said roles are for System Engineers with the date of joining being October 7, 2024. Initially offered a role at the Bengaluru-headquartered company in 2022,┬аthese software engineers were asked to take two pre-training sessions in 2024, with the last one being as recent as August 19. Recently,InfosysCEO Salil Parekh indicated that offers given to freshers would be honoured by the company and followed with joining, although there has been some change in dates. ""Every offer that we have given, that offer will be someone who will join the company. We changed some dates but beyond that everyone will join Infosys and there is no change in that approach,""Parekh had said. However, the fate of around 300 freshers offered a Digital Specialist Engineer┬аrole still remains uncertain,┬аaccording to individuals affected by the delay who spoke to Moneycontrol. ""Together, we are making a difference and ensuring that the voices of young professionals are heard loud and clear,"" said Harpreet Singh Saluja, President,┬аNITES. Moneycontrol has reached out to Infosys for a comment┬аand the story will be updated as and when the company responds. In July, the Bengaluru-based company had said that a small portion of the earlier hirings were pending. The tale began when the company reached out to the candidates, who were issued offer letters in 2020, a couple of months ago. Since then, candidates complained that multiple rounds of pre-training sessions and assessments made them apprehensive about the whole process of hiring. The salary of a System Engineer commanded Rs 3.6 lakh per annum while the position Digital of Specialist Engineer fetched Rs 6.5 lakh per annum, according to the people mentioned above. Pune-based IT employee union NITES filed a request to the Ministry of Labour & Employment to investigate the company for ongoing тАЬexploitation and unprofessional treatmentтАЭ of 2,000 engineering graduates, who were selected for System Engineer and Digital Specialist Engineer roles during the 2022-23 recruitment drive. Infosys had hired over 50,000 freshers in financial year 2022-23 from campuses, which plunged to nearly 11,900 college graduates in FY23-24, CEO and MD Salil Parekh, said in the companyтАЩs annual report released on June 3. This came at a time when the company posted its first ever full-year headcount decline in over two decades. ",2024-09-02 21:08
moneycontrol.com,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/daily-voice-few-pure-play-defence-stocks-still-investible-from-valuation-perspective-says-omniscience-capitals-vikas-gupta-12811742.html,"Daily Voice: Few pure-play defence stocks still investible from valuation perspective, says OmniScience Capital's Vikas Gupta",Vikas Gupta of OmniScience Capital.Related stories.,"Vikas Gupta, CEO and Chief Investment Strategist at OmniScience Capital, believes that the fundamentals of defence stocks remain extremely strong in terms of revenue, profits, growth visibility, and order books extending 5-10 years. According to him, a few pure-play defence stocks are still investible from a valuation perspective, but many others appear overvalued. Much like the defence sector, railway stocks are fundamentally strong with large order books providing growth visibility, but valuations remain a concern, said Gupta who has nearly 20 years of experience in capital markets and holds a BTech degree from IIT Bombay and an MS & Doctorate from Columbia University, New York. While a few exceptions are available at reasonable valuations, investors might consider ancillary or related sectors that could benefit from growth in the railway sector, where valuations might still be reasonable, he said. Do you confidently see a Fed funds rate cut in the September policy meeting? With recent data clearly showing that inflation is being tamed and trending towards the 2 percent target, coupled with unemployment rising to 4.3 percent and the labour market moving toward a better supply-demand balance, the Fed faces a real challenge in keeping rates unchanged in the September meeting. Although there are still only 0.8 unemployed people for each job opening, the Fed may find it difficult to justify maintaining the current rates. In fact, statements from individual FOMC members suggest increasing concern about the risks of keeping rates too high for too long, which could push the economy into a recession. This would jeopardise their ability to fulfill their other two mandates: maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, alongside the well-known goal of controlling inflation. Considering all three mandates, a rate cut seems increasingly necessary. There is even a reasonable probability of a 50 basis point cut in the September meeting, though there is a near-consensus on a 25 basis point cut. Whatâ€™s your take on the Q1FY25 GDP growth numbers? Do you see growth surpassing the 7 percent mark for FY25? While the Q1FY25 GDP numbers were slightly lower than expected, this could be due to the fact that it was an election quarter, leading to relatively low government investmentsâ€”33 percent lower compared to last year. These investments are likely to recover in future quarters. Therefore, a 7 percent+ GDP growth rate for FY25 is quite plausible. The dip observed appears to be an anomaly in the broader trend and pace of GDP growth. The focus should now shift to infrastructure, roads, railways, logistics, PM GatiShakti, digital banking & fintech, power, renewables and clean tech, and digital transformation/AI. Is it time to add defence stocks to the portfolio given the recent correction and consolidation? The fundamentals of defence stocks remain extremely strong in terms of revenue, profits, growth visibility, and order books extending 5-10 years. However, extreme valuations pose a risk to investor returns. A few pure-play defence stocks are still investible from a valuation perspective, but many others appear overvalued. For defence investors, this requires creativity and a broader understanding of the various dimensions of defence in modern geo-strategy. One might consider investing in other dimensions of defence, such as energy security, rare and strategic materials, logistics and supply chains supporting defence forces, and financial and other support for strategic global locations like ports. By broadening oneâ€™s understanding of defence, itâ€™s still possible to gain exposure to the sector in non-traditional ways. However, the portfolio may not look like a typical defence portfolio to those unfamiliar with this approach. Do you foresee a significant increase in private capex given the recent placements, QIPs, and IPOs? Capacity utilisation in the private sector is quite high, and to cater to future demand, significant capex will be required if companies want to avoid losing market share to new entrants. While the private sector is indeed raising equity capital from primary markets, their borrowing capacity is also high due to clean balance sheets and strong cash flows. Additionally, the lending capacity of banks is also robust, supported by clean bank balance sheets, low NPAs, and high CRARs. This twin balance sheet opportunity should drive strong growth in the medium term for the Indian economy. Is it time to stay away from railway stocks? Much like the defence sector, railway stocks are fundamentally strong with large order books providing growth visibility, but valuations remain a concern. While a few exceptions are available at reasonable valuations, investors might consider ancillary or related sectors that could benefit from growth in the railway sector, where valuations might still be reasonable. For example, railways are central to the logistics mission and the GatiShakti program, providing core connectivity for multi-modal logistics hubs. One might also look at logistics or infrastructure companies which would benefit from these large-scale projects. Should one still accumulate technology stocks? With a potential Fed rate cut on the horizon, prospects for the US economy are positive. Furthermore, large capex driven by cloud players investing in AI chips signals that these companies believe Fortune 500 firms will utilise their infrastructure for AI-driven projects in the medium term. It is logical to conclude that these companies will need consulting firms to help train, build, and implement AI models, which is where Indian tech companies are likely to excel over the next several years.

The market is likely to maintain its upward rally, albeit with consolidation and volatility in the coming sessions. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Hero MotoCorp| CMP: Rs 5,578.2  Hero MotoCorp has broken out from a falling channel, signaling a reversal of the trend from up to down. This breakout suggests the completion of a zigzag corrective pattern. Since the previous fall was not an impulse wave, the probability of an upside is high. The momentum indicator MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has entered buy mode on the daily charts, indicating a potential reversal from down to up. From a derivatives perspective, the stock is trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels of Rs 5,500 and Rs 5,544, respectively. The PCR (Put Call Ratio) is at 0.63, suggesting heavy call writing at higher levels, mainly at the Rs 5,600 strike. Once this resistance is cleared, it will further strengthen the upward momentum. The stock has seen significant long buildup recently and has generally witnessed long positions since the July series, indicating a bullish short- to medium-term trend. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 5,745, Rs 5,900 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,445 SRF| CMP: Rs 2,590.3  SRF has been trending higher within an upward-sloping parallel channel. It recently broke out from a symmetrical triangular pattern, indicating continued upward movement. The MACD has provided a bullish crossover on the daily charts, and the weekly momentum is already bullish. From a derivatives perspective, the stock has seen significant short-covering; initially in August, there were heavy short positions, which have now been covered, and some long buildup is evident. A range breakout is anticipated, potentially leading to a sharp short-term upmove. Options data suggests that once the Rs 2,600 strike level is surpassed, there is no major hurdle from Call writers. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,700, Rs 2,800 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,500 SBI Cards and Payment Services| CMP: Rs 744.35  SBI Card has formed a double bottom pattern on the weekly charts. After breaking out from a falling trendline, the stock entered consolidation mode before signaling a potential trend reversal from down to up. The MACD is in buy mode on both the daily and weekly charts, with significant positive divergence indicating a likely reversal. From a derivatives viewpoint, the stock is trading well above its maximum pain and modified maximum pain levels of Rs 730 and Rs 734, respectively. The PCR is 0.64, mainly due to heavy Call writing at Rs 750 and Rs 800 strikes. However, above Rs 750, there is no major resistance until Rs 800. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 800, Rs 825 Stop-Loss: Rs 721 Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment & Securities Radico Khaitan| CMP: Rs 2,010.5  Radico Khaitan has given a bullish breakout from a 38-week-long flat base, signaling a strong upward move. The stock surged above the crucial Rs 2,000 level with significant volume, indicating strong buying interest. During the base formation, volumes were subdued, but the breakout saw a noticeable increase in trading activity, highlighting the stock's momentum. Radico Khaitan has consistently respected its 10-week or 50-day moving average, reflecting a robust technical setup. Investors can consider buying around Rs 2,010 with a closing stop-loss below Rs 1,940, targeting an immediate upside towards Rs 2,200. The stock's technical indicators suggest further gains, making it a promising opportunity for short-term traders. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,100, Rs 2,200 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,940 Indian Oil Corporation| CMP: Rs 178.73  IOC is currently displaying a bullish Cup-and-Handle pattern on its daily chart, which has been forming over the past 145 days. This well-known technical pattern often signals the potential for a strong upward breakout. While the overall volume during the pattern's formation has been low, significant up days have seen heavy trading volumes, indicating a clear accumulation phase. This suggests that institutional investors or large traders are gradually building positions in anticipation of a breakout. For traders, IOC presents a compelling opportunity. It is a preemptive buy at the current market price of Rs 179, with the option to add more on a confirmed breakout above Rs 184. The stock has the potential to rally towards Rs 220, offering a promising upside. To manage risk, a closing stop-loss should be placed below Rs 164. The combination of the Cup-and-Handle pattern with strong volume on up days highlights a favourable setup for bullish traders, making IOC a stock to watch closely in the coming days. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 184, Rs 220 Stop-Loss: Rs 164 Aditya Birla Capital| CMP: Rs 227  Aditya Birla Capital has recently broken out of a 21-day-long Cup-and-Handle pattern on its daily chart, signaling a potential bullish move. Notably, this Cup-and-Handle formation is positioned at the right end of a double bottom pattern, providing additional strength and credibility to the breakout. Double bottom patterns are often seen as powerful reversal signals, and their confluence with the Cup-and-Handle formation suggests a robust technical setup for the stock. Investors might consider buying ABCL at the current market price of Rs 227. To manage risk, a closing stop-loss below Rs 218 is advisable. The immediate target is Rs 245, representing the neckline of the double bottom. A breakout above Rs 245 could propel the stock towards Rs 275, offering significant upside potential in the short term. The combination of these bullish patterns, supported by the recent breakout, makes ABCL an attractive opportunity for traders and investors looking to capitalize on technical strength. With a well-defined risk-reward ratio, ABCL is poised to capture attention in the market.

While the momentum indicators RSI and MACD showed a negative bias on hourly charts, they maintained a positive bias on daily charts. This suggests that consolidation is likely to continue, with 25,300 being a key resistance level. A strong close above this could drive the index toward 25,500, with crucial support at 25,000. For the Bank Nifty, the crucial hurdle remains at 51,500. A breakout above this level could lead to the 52,000 mark, with support at 51,000, according to experts. On Monday, the Nifty 50 climbed 43 points to 25,279, and the Bank Nifty was up 89 points at 51,440. On the NSE, 1,264 shares declined while 1,225 shares advanced. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Technically, the Nifty has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily charts. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is in buy mode on the daily charts but in sell mode on the hourly charts, indicating a sideways to positive momentum. On the downside, 25,200 is an immediate support, and below that, 25,000. A break below 25,200 could lead to a further 200-point correction. On the upside, 25,300 and 25,340 are immediate resistances, above which the index could continue its upward journey toward the next short-term target of 25,500. Thus, the immediate range for the Nifty is between 25,000 and 25,500 levels. From a derivatives perspective, the 25,300 strike has the highest Call open interest among nearby strikes, while the 25,000 strike has the highest Put open interest. This implies that the immediate range is 25,000 to 25,300 levels. There has been heavy Call writing from 25,300 to 25,500 and above, extending to 26,000 levels. Consequently, the PCR (Put-Call Ratio) has dropped below 1, now trading at 0.96, indicating that the short-term uptrend might be exhausting, and profit booking could lead to sideways momentum. Key Resistance: 25,340, 25,500 Key Support: 25,200, 25,000 Strategy: Sell below 25,200, with a target of 25,000 and a stop-loss at 25,310. Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment & Securities The Nifty index has experienced an impressive rally over the last 13 trading sessions, surging by approximately 5 percent. However, this sharp upward move has occurred with limited breadth, raising concerns that a pullback might be imminent. Rapid advances, especially when not widely supported, often suggest a cooling-off period could be approaching. Despite these concerns, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) data presents a more optimistic view. Currently, FIIs hold 2.43 lakh long positions in index futures. While this is below the previous peak of around 4 lakh contracts, it still indicates a significant bullish stance. Additionally, net long positions by FIIs stand at 1.43 lakh contracts, down from a previous high of 5 lakh contracts. This data suggests that there is still room for further upside in the index before a potential correction occurs. Given the upside potential in Nifty's long positions, we anticipate that the market may first attempt to test the 25,500 level. However, this could be followed by a sharp pullback as the index digests its recent gains. Immediate support levels to watch are 25,200, with a more critical support zone around 25,000. If these levels hold, the market could consolidate before making its next move. Key Resistance: 25,500 Key Support: 25,000 Strategy: Traders should remain cautious and consider these key support levels when positioning themselves. The Nifty's current technical setup hints at both opportunity and risk. Buy on dips with a stop-loss at 25,150. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart Technically, the Nifty has entered a fresh expansion phase after surpassing the psychological barrier of 25,000. The next target levels to watch are 25,281, 25,600, and 25,921. The zone between 25,000 and 24,850 has now become an immediate and strong demand area, while the 20-DMA (Days Moving Average) support is positioned at the 24,600 level. Key Resistance: 25,281, 25,600, 25,921 Key Support: 25,000, 24,850, 24,600 Strategy: Consider buying on dips near 25,000, with a stop-loss at 24,600 and a target of 25,600. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities The Bank Nifty has been gradually forming higher tops and higher bottoms, which is bullish in the short term. However, the slope of the uptrend indicates a lack of momentum. The positive aspect is that the index has been holding the 51,000 level, which was a crucial hurdle before it broke out. The MACD indicator is in buy mode on both daily and hourly charts, thus the short-term trend is positive. Resistances on the upside are at 51,850, 51,900, 52,000, and 52,300 levels. Therefore, the immediate range is 51,000 to 52,300 levels. From a derivatives perspective, the 51,500 strike has the highest open interest on the Call side, indicating that the index is trading near the upper end of the range. If it manages to surpass this level, it could trigger sharp short-covering on the way up. The 51,000 strike Put has the highest open interest, so the immediate range is narrow, between 51,000 and 51,500 levels. The PCR is trading at 0.85, which is bearish, hence only above 51,500 will there be a meaningful upward move in the near term. Key Resistance: 51,500 Key Support: 51,000 Strategy: Buy above 51,500, targeting 52,000 and 52,300, with a stop-loss at 51,200. Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investment & Securities The Bank Nifty has been underperforming relative to the Nifty, largely due to the muted performance of HDFC Bank, one of its key constituents. The index is currently facing significant resistance on the daily chart, particularly at the 45-degree downward-inclined quarterly VWAP (volume weighted average price) in the 51,500-51,600 range. For the Bank Nifty to regain relative strength and push higher, it needs to decisively break above the 51,600 level. If this happens, the index could quickly rally toward its all-time high, above the 53,000 mark. On the downside, the index has immediate support at 51,000, with a more critical support zone at 50,800. If these levels hold, the Bank Nifty could consolidate before making a decisive move. For traders, the key level to watch is 51,600. A sustained move above this resistance could signal a strong bullish phase, while failure to do so may keep the index in its current range-bound state. As the market awaits a clear direction, these support and resistance levels will be crucial in determining the next move for the Bank Nifty. Key Resistance: 51,600 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800 Strategy: Buy on dips with a stop-loss of 51,250. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart The Bank Nifty needs to break above its 50-DMA at 51,550 to gain momentum. If it succeeds in crossing this key level, a significant short-covering rally could push it toward the 52,000â€“52,300 zone. On the downside, 50,950 serves as immediate support, with 50,000 being a crucial support level. Key Resistance: 51,550, 52,000, 52,300 Key Support: 50,950, 50,000 Strategy: Consider buying on dips near 50,950-51,000, with a stop-loss at 50,000 and a target of 52,000. ",2024-09-02 20:00

Madhabi Puri Buch took an income of Rs 16.8 crore from ICICI Bank group during 2017-2024, Pawan Khera told reporters at a press briefing. Khera said that Buch received income from the group unit ICICI Prudential as well. Khera said that several probes on ICICI Bank were being adjudicated while Madhabi Puri Buch was receiving the income from the group. He cited unnamed reports that suggest that SEBI chief relaxed norms for ICICI Bank. However, ICICI Bank has dismissedÂ all the allegationsÂ againstÂ BuchÂ stating that neither the bank nor its group companies have paid any salary or granted any employee stock options plans (ESOPs) to her. â€śICICI BankÂ or its group companies have not paid any salary or granted any ESOPs to Ms. Madhabi Puri Buch after her retirement, other than her retiral benefits.

It has a very important role to play,â€ť said Khera in his attack on Madhabi Puri Buch, questioning why she drew income from ICICI Bank while being a full-time SEBI member. He then targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, for appointing Buch. â€śWho appoints the chairperson of SEBI?

This number rose toÂ 70Â percent of shares by value, within a year of listing, the study found. Flipping Behaviour A strong pattern ofÂ disposition was evident among investors, Sebi said, implying selling of assetsÂ that have increased in value while holding on to those that have decreased. Sebi's study was based on investor behaviour in 144 Main Board public issues, and found that ""flipping"" was highly prevalent among individual investors. Returns heavily influenced the investor behaviour, Sebi found, as investors sold 67.6 percent of shares by value within a week, when IPO returns exceeded 20 percent. In contrast, only 23.3 percent of shares by value were sold on instances when the returns were negative. This rush for public issues also stems from a trend of rise in demat accounts that were created after Covid-19. In terms of the demat accounts that were used to bid for shares in the IPOs, the study found that almost half of the total allotted demat accounts for IPOs during April 2021- December 2023, were opened in the post-COVID period - between CY21 and CY23. Furthermore, 85 percent of the total allotted demat accounts (for the IPOs under study) were opened in the last eight years between 2016 and 2023.

Further, there were more than 90 IPOs â€” 92, to be precise â€” that saw subscription in excess of 10 times with a mere two IPO remaining undersubscribed. Although, there were some laggards post listing, it did not deterred enthusiasm in new IPOs, stated the Sebi paper. In terms of the geographical spread of investors, the study found that about 70 per cent of the IPO investors were from the top four states â€” Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Interestingly, Gujarat cornered the maximum allotment in IPOs with retail investors from Gujarat receiving 39.3 per cent of the cumulative allotment in the retail category, followed by Maharashtra (13.5 percent), Rajasthan (10.5 percent). In the NII category as well, Gujarat occupied the top position with getting about 42.3 per cent of the total allotment in NII Category, followed by Maharashtra (20.4 percent) and Rajasthan (15.5 percent). Not surprisingly, a clear positive correlation was found between the first week listing gain and percentage of shares exited within a week by retail and NII category investors. According to the Sebi study, the IPOs which witnessed a gain of more than 20 per cent within a week witnessed NIIs exiting 79.1 percent of their shares within a week - compared to average exit of 63.3 per cent - while retail investors exited 61.9 per cent shares, when returns were very high (compared to average exit of 42.7 per cent). Also Read:Â70% individual investors in equity cash segment incurred losses in FY23: Sebi study A similar positive correlation was observed between IPO subscription, listing day returns, and exit of investors in terms of percentage of shares sold in value terms.

RegulatoryÂ Effect Soon after RBIâ€™s guidelines on IPO financing by NBFCs, Sebi noted that over-subscription in the NII category halved, from 38 times to 17 times. The average application from Non-Institutional Investor (NII) category seeking over Rs 1 crore in IPOs fell from approximately 626 per IPO to around 20 per IPO, after Sebi's policy interventions in the NII share allotment process.

But SEBIâ€™s whole-time member Ashwini Bhatia, who was speaking at CIIâ€™s Financing 3.0 Summit, believes that there needs to be some caution. On SME IPOâ€™s Bhatia said, ""Nobody is actually saying no. I am a banker, and we were taught to say no when necessary."" Bhatia added that unfortunately, this rigorous approach is sometimes lacking in the current ecosystem, including among chartered accountants, merchant bankers, and exchanges. Bhatia added, ""Be good doctors to these companies. Donâ€™t give them steroids when they can survive on paracetamol.""

""Instead of going straight to an IPO, a better route might be to approach an angel fund or a venture fund first,"" he suggested.

These opportunities are there but one needs to go slow,â€ť he explained. In order to unlock the true potential of MSMEs, Bhatia noted that there is a need for more partnerships.

""Inclusion remains a critical aspect of Viksit Bharat, encompassing not just economic and gender inclusion but also language and cultural inclusion. To achieve this inclusive growth, we must focus on creating products that are accessible and viable, such as the Rs 250 micro SIPs,"" Buch said while speaking at the CII Financing 3.0 Summit. ""This involves ensuring that costs are kept low and that the benefits of economies of scale are passed on to investors. Ultimately, our goal is to facilitate capital formation and wealth creation in a seamless, efficient, low-cost, and highly inclusive way,"" she added. Further, while elaborating on the role of the capital market watchdog, she said that the view within Sebi is that capital formation has two sides -- creating capital for industry growth and generating wealth for citizens. ""... initiatives like the Rs 250 micro SIPs are designed to allow even the smallest investors to participate in wealth creation. Technology and low costs make this possible, enabling people to invest even with just a few dollars a month,"" she said. ""Looking ahead, our market ecosystem will be driven by technology and a diverse range of products and participants.

This co-creation is not just a preference, it's a necessity, she said. According to Buch, there are two data points that highlight Indiaâ€™s growth trajectory. The first is taxes. Buch cited the example of tax collections, including GST. The rising tax collections, Buch believes, suggests that India's economy is on a solid growth path. Energy consumption is also a key metric, she said. Buch also spoke about creating a regulatory framework focused on speed, affordability, focus and inclusivity.

Brent crude prices have fallen close to 7 percent in five sessions amid a decline in demand from China, the world's largest oil importer. Furthermore, expectations ofÂ an increase in OPEC+ production starting in October to make up forÂ a significant decline in output from Libya, have added pressure on oil prices. According to aReutersreport, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, plan to move forward with an oil output hike in October. Specifically, eight OPEC+ members are slated to boost production by 180,000 barrels per day (bpd)as part of a strategy to gradually unwind their recent 2.2 million bpd cuts while keeping other reductions in place until the end of 2025. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog On account of this, Brent crude prices have slipped from a high of over $80 per barrel to now near $76 per barrel. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs also predicted that Brent crude prices might slip to $68 per barrelÂ by late 2025 if China oil demand remains flat through end of next year. A decline in crude prices benefit oil marketing companies (OMCs) in several ways. Firstly, it reduces their input costs and give then more leeway to make higher margins as they can maintain or even increase the prices of refined products like petrol and diesel. Additionally, OMCsÂ can also enjoy the benefit ofÂ inventory gains as they replenish stocks at lower prices. In addition, lower fuel pricesÂ may also boost consumer demand, driving higher sales volumes, lifting revenues for these players. ",2024-09-02 13:01

Itâ€™s now time to rotate some of the money to corporate debt, according to an asset manager at a $102 billion fund house. ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. is slashing holdings of sovereign debt in its top-performing dynamic bond fund, Manish Banthia, chief investment officer for fixed income, said in an interview. Heâ€™s instead putting money in investment-grade corporate bonds with one- to three-year maturity, and in certificates of deposits. â€śGiven that many corporates have deleveraged, the risk in non-financial corporate bonds is quite low, making this segment appealing from a risk-return perspective,â€ť Banthia said. â€śConversely, sovereign bond markets appear overvalued, offering limited medium-term returns.â€ť His views come as some of his peers debate whether Indiaâ€™s long-tenor bonds are becoming too crowded on index-related inflows and bets the central bank will cut interest rates. At the same time, demand for Indian assets is driving corporates to raise money via debt markets and initial public offerings versus bank loans, as better rates sweeten the deal for them. Thatâ€™s keeping debt loads and credit risk manageable for companies.  The ICICI Prudential All Seasons Bond Fund, which Banthia has helped manage since 2012, is the best performing in its segment on a 10-year basis, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India data. The fund cut its sovereign bond holdings to 55.6 percent in July, from 61.1 percent in April, according to their latest fact sheet. Corporate debt holdings rose to 33.5 percent, from 28.9 percent, during the period. The tide is turning for higher-yielding assets globally, as the Federal Reserve looks set to cut rates in September. Thatâ€™s led to global money rushing into Asian bonds this year, with offshore investors pouring nearly $13 billion into Indian debt, according to data compiled byBloomberg. The countryâ€™s sovereign debt is among the best performing in Asia this year so far. The rally stalled recently, hovering near a closely watched threshold of 6.85 percent. The 10-year bond traded in a narrow range on Friday. â€śThe marketâ€™s current momentum is driven by favorable demand-supply dynamics. However, valuations in fixed income markets appear expensive, presenting more risk than return,â€ť Banthia said. â€śWhile momentum investing may seem appealing, we remain cautious at this point of time.â€ť ",2024-09-02 11:50

The brokerage maintained its ""Buy"" recommendation for larger sugar companies such asBalrampur Chini Mills,Triveni Engineering, andDalmia Bharat Sugar. The government's recent decision to lift restrictions on ethanol production from sugarcane juice and B-heavy molasses routes is likely to drive up ethanol prices before the new season begins, DAM Capital said. In a notification, issued by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs on August 29, the government announced that ethanol can now be produced from all available feedstocks, including sugarcane juice, B-heavy, C-heavy molasses, and grains. Additionally, sugar mills and standalone distilleries are now permitted to procure up to 2.3 million tonnes of rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for ethanol production. This move marked a reversal of policies imposed in December 2023, which had restricted ethanol production from these routes due to rising sugar prices in the lead-up to the 2024 general election.┬ĀThese changes, according to DAM Capital, are expected to reinvigorate the ethanol blending program for the 2024-25 season.

With gross sugar production expected to remain at 32 million tonnes, surpassing the consumption rate of 29 million tonnes, there will be a surplus of over 5 million tonnes available for ethanol production. DAM Capital estimates that approximately 4-5 million tonnes of sugar will be diverted towards ethanol production, sufficient for the production of 4.5 to 5 billion litres of ethanol. This development is expected to allow sugar companies to fully utilise their distillery capacities, which have been underutilised at around 60-70 percent due to feedstock restrictions last season. The report also said that it will improve the economies of grain-based ethanol. The availability of FCI rice for ethanol production, coupled with sufficient molasses supply, is expected to enhance operating margins for grain ethanol, projected to reach 10-12 percent.┬Ā""We believe grain ethanol economies would improve significantly from 2024-25 procurement year,"" the report said. Given the current inventory levels and the anticipated increase in distillery utilisation rates, DAM Capital is optimistic about larger sugar companies. The brokerage identified Balrampur Chini Mills as a strong performer, estimating that it will produce 320 million litres of ethanol/ENA (Extra Neutral Alcohol) by FY26 through its distillery operations. Follow our live blog for all the market action Triveni Engineering is also expected to benefit from higher sugarcane crushing following the acquisition of a new plant in western Uttar Pradesh last year.

In a conversation with Moneycontrol, he also said that consumption would be a key theme going ahead because India is a growing population. Edited excerpts: What is your view on the current state of the Indian stock markets, especially in terms of valuations as the analyst community seems divided with many viewing it as expensive and hence advise investors to be cautious?People who say the markets are expensive are often looking at India with a â€śreversion to meanâ€ť mindset, thinking that historical patterns will repeat. But India is in a transformation phase, and in such times, reversion to mean doesn't apply. India is in a very different place now. So, while the markets aren't cheap, they aren't expensive either. Earnings growth is strong, and there are structural revivals happening. We see continuity in liquidity and earnings growth, which will drive the market higher. Of course, it's important to keep expectations low. Given recent returns, the immediate future might not deliver the same, but over a 5-10 years view, India will continue to deliver some of the best returns globally. What filters do you use for stock selection, especially in the current market scenario?Our approach doesnâ€™t change based on the market scenario. We strongly focus on the quality of management, followed by the business model - whether thereâ€™s talent and growth potential - and reasonable valuations. We avoid stocks or sectors that are euphoric where everyone is chasing them. What are the major themes you are focusing on going forward?India is in a transformative phase. Our demographics - being the youngest, most populous, and most aspirational nation in the world - are driving opportunities. Consumption is a key driver of growth, and we have been bullish on manufacturing since October 2020. Manufacturing in India today is where China was in 2005, and we see a massive wealth creation opportunity. Financials also remain robust, and our banking system is one of the best globally. There are plenty of opportunities in credit, non-credit, and IT services, as well as disruptive ideas within these sectors. Infrastructure, especially railways, seems overvalued. How do you view such sectors?If too much growth is already factored into the value, we avoid those investments. You shouldnâ€™t buy expensive stocks just because the sector is in development. Itâ€™s like how many people bought new-age stocks in 2021 out of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) and ended up losing money. Investing is not about following the crowd but about finding value and adjusting for risk. Any new age company stock that you have?Ola Electric, it has a 35-40 percent market share and is launching new vehicles. They will turn profitable this year, and once that happens, they could become a large player in the automobile industry. On the consumption side, are you focusing on any specific segments like discretionary spending or QSR?Discretionary spending will do better, but we see opportunities across the board as the lower levels of society upgrade. Weâ€™re focusing on premiumisation, home improvement, and building materials, among others. Each segment has potential, but it depends on the company and sector. What are your top three bets currently?We own Aditya Birla Capital, which we bought at Rs 100 and is now around Rs 230. We also hold CDMO (contract development and manufacturing organisations) players like Laurus Labs, Newland, and Syngene. We are bullish on the CDMO space, and recently weâ€™ve invested in chemicals like SRF, Deepak Nitrite, and Rallis India, seeing good opportunities there. Could you elaborate on why you are bullish on the chemical sector?In 2022, due to supply chain disruptions, buyers overstocked, leading to a lack of orders later. But now that inventory has cleared, growth is returning. On the PMS side, do you think the tax on churn is a problem for clients?Taxes are inevitable. The only argument could be about the tax on internal churning. However, many stocks we hold for five years or more, so the tax impact is minimal. The trade-off is between alpha generation and tax. In a PMS, we can be more nimble and agile than mutual funds, which comes with its own advantages. ",2024-09-02 10:05

This means eligible shareholders will receive one new fully paid-up equity share of Rs 1 each for every two existing fully paid-up equity shares as of the record date, pending approval at the upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM). A bonus issue is when a company issues additional shares to existing shareholders for free, based on the number of shares they already own. This is typically done using the company's reserves and surplus, and it increases the total number of shares outstanding without raising new capital. NBCC (India)Â has set October 7 as the record date to determine eligibility for the bonus shares. A total of 90 crore shares are proposed to be issued, drawn from free reserves created out of profits as per the audited financial statements as of March 31, 2024.

The bonus shares are expected to be credited within two months of board approval, by October 31, 2024.

At 9:20am, the stock was trading at Rs 2175 on BSE, up 7 percent from previous close while India's benchmark Sensex gained 0.25 percent to 82575 points. The brokerage expects Thangamayil Jewellery, a prominent player in Tamil Nadu, to achieve a revenue CAGR of 26 percent, EBITDA CAGR of 33 percent, and PAT CAGR of 41 percent over FY24-27. This growth is fueled by the advantages of formalization, rapid store expansion, value-for-money products, and access to capital at competitive rates. ""We view TJL as the D-Mart of Tamil Nadu's jewellery retail sector, applying principles of ""high inventory turns and reasonable margins,"" in contrast to other listed jewellery players who focus on ""high operating margins and low inventory turns"" to generate respectable return ratios"", HDFC Securities said in a latest note. HDFC Securities expects a significant rerating as Thangamayil Jewellery's ROE rises from 18 percent in FY23 to 32 percent in FY27, significantly outperforming Titan, the market leader in the organized jewellery sector. The brokerage also expects Thangamayil Jewellery to open 30 large-format stores between FY25-27, nearly doubling its current store area, and forecasts a 26 percent sales CAGR over FY24-27, driven by strong external and internal tailwinds. Historically, the company has been conservative in expansion, adding only 19 stores from FY14 to FY24. The formalization of the jewellery industry has accelerated since the hallmarking norms were introduced in June 2021. Additionally, theUnion Budget's reduction of import duty from 15 percent to 6 percent in July 2024 is expected to further benefit the sector, it said. Organized jewellers like Thangamayil are well-positioned to capture a larger share of the Tamil Nadu market. Initially, many customers are expected to shift from small, traditional jewellers to value-focused retailers, drawn by the latter's ability to provide a superior customer experience, a broader product range in larger store formats, lower making charges, and access to finance at competitive rates (with average borrowing costs falling from 6.7 percent in FY20 to 4.8 percent in FY24), it added.

However, they expect some sequential uptick in the second half of FY25, supported by strong capex and revival in rural consumption. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs said that the sluggish GDP growth was in-line with their estimates, but expect some progress in the second half owing to improved consumption and strong capex programme.

The brokerage drew parallels between the US market's performance in 2023 versus that in 2024 and highlighted that while sector contributions to the S&P 500's gains were relatively balanced in 2023, it has seen greater disparity in 2024. Telecom, media, and technology sectors have driven most of the index's returns this year. The brokerage also noted that while the macro-driven environment of 2022 and 2023 saw assets reacting mainly to inflation, interest rates, and other macroeconomic factors, 2024 has seen the market shift more towards micro fundamentals. Along with this, Morgan Stanley highlighted that its internally maintained S&P 500 risk-on/risk-off model, which measures shared risk and market-wide co-movements, has declined this year, further suggesting that macroeconomic factors are weighing less on equity markets. This trend has also coincided with an uptick in stock-specific risk, hinting that fundamentals are increasingly influencing stock prices. Accordingly, Morgan Stanley believes that these dynamics are a direct result of the higher interest rate environment, which has resulted in increased opportunities for alpha production conducive to hedge fund strategies seeking to deliver skill-based returns to investors. ""These environments have led to an outsized performance by long/short equity market-neutral hedge funds which are reliant on stock picking to generate their returns,"" Morgan Stanley wrote. On the contrary, the brokerage also highlighted that the same environment has not been beneficial for alpha production by long-only equity managers, noting that these funds are likely to underperform index-level returns if they don't own the select stocks that drove much of the gains in 2024. Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Morgan Stanley further charts out two other reasons that uniquely position hedge funds to deliver better returns in the current scenarios--their ability to generate both long and short alpha and their unconstrained approach versus traditional benchmarks. Against this backdrop, Morgan Stanley believes the environment will continue to offer abundant alpha opportunities for hedge funds. ""Even though the Federal Reserve is likely to start cutting interest rates, we expect base rates to remain historically high, which should sustain market dispersion and stock-picking prospects,"" the brokerage stated. ""Additionally, upcoming elections and the potential for shifts in US leadership could create further opportunities for selecting individual stocks based on policy impacts. We remain confident that hedge funds will make the most of these ongoing opportunities and that incorporating market-neutral strategies could benefit a well-balanced portfolio,"" it added.

Despite healthy demand and cost moderation, muted cement prices are expected to keep Q2 and Q3 earnings subdued, the brokerage said. Sluggish domestic demand significantly contributed to the muted performance in Q1FY25, and cement companies are unlikely to see a drastic improvement in Q2 as well. Macquarie in its latest note also highlighted that successful delivery on cost efficiency targets could further enhance margins, but advised waiting for better entry points, suggesting that improved earnings visibility and valuation would offer more favourable opportunities. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action The international brokerage firm has issued mixed calls on various cement stocks, reflecting a cautious outlook for the sector. Analysts at Macquarie maintained an 'Outperform' rating on Dalmia Bharat and has slightly raised the target price on the stock. However, it adopted a more neutral stance on other major players like Ramco Cement, ACC, Ambuja, Shree Cement, and UltraTech Cement.Â For these stocks, Macquarie has either adjusted target prices downward or made modest upward revisions, indicating a balanced view of their potential amidst ongoing sector challenges.  Notably, several cement companies tried to raise prices in August, but many of these increases were reversed due to weak demand. A recent report by Elara Securities indicates that a significant price hike of Rs 40-50 per bag is expected in East India, while firms in other regions may attempt more modest increases of Rs 10-25 per bag. However, these hikes are likely to be partially rolled back, given the weak demand and lack of pricing discipline among companies. The outlook for the sector for H1FY25 is subdued, with cement prices falling for ten consecutive months, reaching a three-year low. Despite concerns about weak demand, investors are unlikely to offload shares, as demand is expected to pick up in the second half of the fiscal, according to Nirmal Bang. With election-related disruptions behind and the monsoon season ending, analysts anticipate a resumption of construction activity, which, along with post-festival demand, could help revive cement prices.

This broad market rally propelled benchmark and smaller indices to new heights, despite foreign investors selling approximately Rs 19,000 crore in the cash market over the week. This brought total FII selling for the month to over Rs 21,000 crore. A surprise bonus issue by Reliance Industries further boosted the Indian markets. Globally, markets delivered mixed returns. US markets were shaken by Nvidia's earnings, which led to a 10 percent drop at its lowest point, erasing $300 billion in market capitalisation. Despite Nasdaq's nearly one percent decline, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 closed in positive territory. European markets gained during the week, with the Euro Stoxx 600 closing 1.34 percent higher, marking a fourth consecutive week of gains. Lower-than-expected inflation numbers fuelled the rally. Germany's DAX hit a new high, rising 1.47 percent, while Italy's FTSE MIB led the European surge with a 2.15 percent gain. Headline annual inflation in the eurozone slowed to 2.2 percent in August from 2.6 percent in July, the lowest level in three years. In Asia, Japanese markets ended the week 0.7 percent higher, recovering from earlier losses in the month due to the unwinding of the Yen carry trade. Meanwhile, Chinese stocks declined as economists lowered their 2024 growth forecasts to below five percent, with poor corporate earnings adding further pressure on the market. A likely pause The Nifty closed higher for the third consecutive week, marking an impressive 12-day winning streak, nearing a record. The weekly upper band at 25,700 suggests there is still room for the market to rise, even in the face of short-term corrections or volatility. As a result, it's a ""buy on dips"" market. However, the extended winning streak also warrants caution, as pullbacks are inevitable in a bull run. The 25,000 level has solidified as a strong support. Meanwhile, the daily swing is now making lower highs, even as the Nifty continues to climb. Recently, negative divergences between the swing and price have led to short-term corrections lasting two days or more, depending on the situation. This development will keep us vigilant in the short term.

This move will give BYD more control over its operations in Germany, where it sold just over 4,000 vehicles last year, but has seen a decline in sales this year due to a broader downturn in EV demand.

A holiday in the United States and Canada made for thin liquidity, while wins for far-right parties in German state elections added a fresh layer of political uncertainty. The dollar was hanging on to gains made on Friday after upbeat spending figures led markets to trim the chance of a half-point easing from the Federal Reserve. Futures are 100% priced for a cut of 25 basis points on Sept. 18, and imply a 33% probability of 50 basis points. They also have 100 basis points of cuts priced in by December, and 120 basis points for 2025. The Bank of Canada is expected to cut again on Wednesday, with markets implying a 22% chance of 50 basis points. Crucial for the Fed will be the payrolls report on Friday where analysts look for a rise of 165,000 in jobs and a dip in the unemployment rate to 4.2%. â€ťThe risks going into this crucial release seem highly asymmetric as a solid report is very unlikely to derail the September cut,â€ť said Barclays economist Christian Keller. â€ťIn contrast, a weak report would likely validate the popular narrative that the U.S. economy and labour market are on the precipice, necessitating a fast and deep cutting cycle, leading to another sharp repricing.â€ť Fed Governor Christopher Waller and NY Fed President John Williams happen to be speaking after the job data, giving the market a near-instant reaction. Also important this week will be the ISM surveys, JOLTS job openings and ADP employment, trade and the Fedâ€™s Beige Book. Those risks kept investors cautious and S&P 500 futures dipped 0.1%, while Nasdaq futures eased 0.2%. DOLLAR FINDS SUPPORT Asian markets mostly followed Fridayâ€™s rally on Wall Street, with Japanâ€™s Nikkei up 1.0% and adding to last weekâ€™s 8.7% bounce. [.N] MSCIâ€™s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1%, while South Korean stocks were flat. Cash Treasuries were untraded for the holidays, while Treasury futures were little moved. Ten-year yields stood at 3.914% after rising in the wake of Fridayâ€™s inflation and spending data. [US/] That rise underpinned the U.S. dollar at 146.55 yen, having rallied 1.2% last week and it now faces chart resistance around 148.54. The euro was stuck at $1.1046, after losing 1.3% last week, with political uncertainty in Germany not helping. The European Central Bank (ECB) is considered certain to cut its rates by a quarter point next week following benign EU inflation figures. â€ťHowever, the path after is less clear with financial markets currently pricing around 1-1/2 cuts over the remaining two meetings of the year,â€ť said Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at CBA. â€ťWe have one more cut in 2024 after September, but acknowledge that it will be a close call between one or two more cuts.â€ť The firmer dollar combined with higher bond yields to pressure gold prices at $2,502 an ounce, short of its recent all-time top of $2,531.60. Oil prices lost more ground as the market pondered the prospect of increased supply from OPEC+ in October. Brent fell 41 cents to $76.50 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 38 cents to $73.17 per barrel.

He is the Founder and Director of Ayan Analytics, which has developed ZodiacAnalyst, a research software with time and price charting tools. Read previous columns here Review: We were not expecting the Nifty to hit a new high, and the aggression seen in the technology space took us by surprise. We were anticipating bullishness,Â  butÂ not so early. The pharma sector is back, and also hit aÂ new highÂ as did most stocks in the sector. Most PSU stocks also witnessed profit booking byÂ  big investors. Speciality chemicals stocks are back in focus, and withÂ a fresh up-move in the Chinese economy, it looks like the broader chemicals space will see a nice recovery in prices and manufacturing will pick up. Lots of activity in the small and midcap space is noticed, and signs of madness areÂ  seen in the price movement and IPO market frenzy. However, banking and defence, as expected, are showing signs of cooling off. TechnicalWe did not expect the markets to hit a new high so aggressively. As always, one has to keep taking chances, and some short selling got triggeredÂ based onÂ short-term indicators. Interestingly, while the Nifty hit a new high, many investors found that their portfolio had not recovered or outperformed, which is the first sign ofÂ sectoralÂdivergence. Thanks to the new high, the weekly or medium-term stop has shifted closer to 23,890, the short-term stop has moved to 24,100, and the long-term stop has moved to the 21,100 level, making things better for investors. As a strategy, we had recommended that you improve the quality ofÂ your portfolio, move from high-beta to low-beta stocks, and hold more cash. We believe it is time to hold investments with a strict stop and continue the ride, but keep booking profits andmoveÂ into a safe zone strategy. Time mapLast week, technology largecaps once again witnessed big inflows, as expected.We have been noticing a distribution happening in many counters August 10th onwardsÂ as many smart traders are reshuffling their portfoliosÂ  and positioning themselves well. InÂ maghaphase markets hit a new high, and theÂ sunÂ being in its ownnakshatraand own house wasÂ good for the markets. Now we are in nakshatraof Venus, and profit-booking is advisedÂ â€”Â distribution Â happens here, mature investments are exited, and new ideas executed. Distribution happens when the market sentiment is very positive â€” hence,Â auto, technology, and capital goods will continue to rally. Indeed, the technicals are indicating an extended rally. For another 10 days, keep reshuffling and build up your cash position toÂ invest in bad times. Post September 13th, weÂ  expect divergence indicatorsÂ to give the best results. September 2, 2024: Monday: Amavasya. Magha 24.20: bullish dayMarket sentiment will be positive. People will be aggressive in the small and midcap space. Clean up old portfolios, exit counters which have become active in the recent frenzy. Participate after 10 am for better clarity, and keep an eye on cement and auto stocks for intra-day activity. September 03, 2024: Tuesday: S.1: Purva: bad dayA bad day in the markets is basically a tough day to make money. Intra-day trading would be tough on a bad day and little easy on a good day. The moon is in a bad shapeÂ â€”Â those who go for multiple positions in the market will find themselves in a mess, and day traders will lose a lot of money today. Mars 90 NeptuneÂ â€” major goof up or failure will hurt a big group and global markets. It's an important day. STBT (sell today, buy tomorrow) based on contrarian positions is indicated . September 04, 2024: Wednesday: S.2: Uttara: auspicious dayA gap down openingÂ cannot be ruled out, and a higher opening should be used for selling. Short sellingÂÂ isÂ recommended as an intra-day strategy. Divergence indicators would give the best results today. BTST (buy today, sell tomorrow) is highly recommended after 14:30. September 05, 2024: Thursday: S.3: Hasta: auspicious dayTheÂthirdÂ tithiÂ indicates a directional move,Â mostly positive. The Hasta nakshatra rewards only patient traders and investors, so use lag indicators or participate in signals that have reconfirmed earlier signalsÂ â€” slow and delayed action will pay very well. FMCG and banks will hog the limelight. STBT is indicated. September 06, 2024: Friday: S.4: Chitra: gap openingThe direction of the gap plays a very criticalÂ  role today. The gap getting filled quickly is not a good sign, andÂ  markets can move further in that direction. TheÂ tithicreates confusion and favours bearish traders.

The maximum Put writing was observed at the 25,200 strike, which saw an addition of 32.23 lakh contracts, followed by the 25,000 and 25,300 strikes, with 18.55 lakh and 17.81 lakh contracts added, respectively, while there was hardly any Put unwinding seen.  5)Bank Nifty Call Options Data According to the weekly options data, the 51,500 strike holds the maximum open interest, with 25.89 lakh contracts.

Maximum Call writing was visible at the 51,400 strike (with the addition of 5.76 lakh contracts), followed by the 52,000 strike (5.47 lakh contracts) and the 52,200 strike (5.23 lakh contracts), while the maximum Call unwinding was seen at the 51,200 strike, which shed 5.79 lakh contracts, followed by the 51,000 and 51,100 strikes, which shed 3.09 lakh and 2.2 lakh contracts respectively.  6)Bank Nifty Put Options Data On the Put side, the maximum open interest was seen at the 51,000 strike (with 20.66 lakh contracts), which can act as a key support level for the index.

The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9)India VIX The volatility index sustained below the 14 mark and all key moving averages on a closing basis, although it tested the 10-day EMA intraday for four days in a row, making the trend favourable for bulls.

The index moved within a 400-point range and closed the week with a gain of 1.66 percent, settling just above the 25,200 markâ€”a new milestone. Notably, individual stocks outperformed, significantly boosting the broader market indices. The Nifty Midcap 100 index saw a rise of approximately 1.25 percent, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index rallied by over 1 percent, reflecting strong investor sentiment across various segments. From a technical perspective, the outlook for the Nifty 50 index remains optimistic. However, the 25,600 to 25,800 range is anticipated to serve as a critical resistance level due to the presence of a bearish Crab Harmonic structure on the daily chart. This pattern may induce profit-taking near these levels, suggesting that while another upward push is possible, it could be followed by a pullback. The index is expected to find support in the 25,000 to 24,800 zone. On the other hand, the Nifty Bank index exhibited more sideways movement throughout the week, closing in the green with a weekly gain of 0.82 percent, near the 51,300 mark. The immediate resistance for this index is seen around 51,500, and a close above this level on the daily chart could propel the index towards the 52,000 mark in the coming week. However, if the index falls below the 50,800 level, it could negatively impact the sentiment in banking stocks. Here are three stock recommendations for short term: Som Distilleries and Breweries| CMP: Rs 112.2  Som Distilleries reached a peak of approximately Rs 149 in May 2024. Since then, the stock has experienced a significant decline, losing about 29 percent in price. This sharp drop brought the stock down to a critical support level, forming a triple bottom pattern within the range of Rs 105-108. The triple bottom pattern, occurring at a previous demand zone, is often considered a bullish signal, suggesting that the stock has found strong support at these levels and may be poised for a reversal. In the most recent trading session, the stock saw a surge in trading volume, indicating renewed investor interest. The price action in this session was strong enough to break through a 3-4 month-long bearish trendline, signaling a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. Additionally, a similar trendline violation has been observed in the RSI on the daily chart, further confirming the bullish momentum. These technical developments make the stock an attractive buy candidate at current levels. Based on this analysis, we recommend going long in the price range of Rs 110-114, targeting Rs 128. To manage risk, a stop-loss should be placed at Rs 104 on a daily closing basis, ensuring protection against any further downside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 128 Stop-Loss: Rs 104 Hikal| CMP: Rs 329.3  Between March 2023 and June 2024, Hikal was in a consolidation phase, trading within a relatively narrow range of Rs 260 to Rs 320. This prolonged consolidation period suggests that the stock was in a phase of accumulation, where neither buyers nor sellers had the upper hand. However, the stock eventually broke out of this range, supported by significant trading volume, which is often a strong indicator of a shift in market sentiment towards bullishness.Following this breakout, Hikal rallied by nearly Rs 40, underscoring the strength of the breakout. Despite this rally, the recent correction in the stock price presents a renewed buying opportunity. From a technical perspective, the weekly Ichimoku base line is now acting as a crucial support level, aligning closely with the breakout range. This confluence of support levels suggests that the stock is well-positioned for further upside, making it a compelling buy. Given these technical indicators, it is advisable to buy Hikal within the price range of Rs 325 to Rs 335. The stock shows potential for an upside target of Rs 400, which represents a significant gain from current levels. To manage downside risk, a stop-loss should be placed at Rs 295 on a daily closing basis, ensuring that any potential losses are limited if the stock fails to hold its support levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 400 Stop-Loss: Rs 295 Patel Engineering| CMP: Rs 57.21 After reaching a peak around the Rs 70 mark in July 2024, Patel Engineering experienced a notable correction, losing 27 percent from its recent high. This sharp pullback brought the stock down to a critical support level, located within the demand zone of Rs 50-53, a level that previously acted as a strong support during its prior uptrend. At this crucial support level, a bullish BAT pattern has emergedâ€”a harmonic pattern known for signaling potential bullish reversals. The bullish bat pattern is typically formed when the price action retraces to specific Fibonacci levels, indicating that the stock is poised for a reversal from its recent decline. The emergence of this pattern, combined with the stock finding support at a key demand zone, creates a strong confluence of technical indicators pointing towards a potential upward move. Given these favourable technical signals, the current price levels are considered attractive for buying. Therefore, it is recommended to buy the stock within the Rs 55-58 range, with a target of Rs 68. To manage risk and protect against further downside, a stop-loss should be placed near Rs 51 on a daily closing basis. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 68 ",2024-09-01 16:37

The market may consolidate before showing further upward movement in the coming sessions. Below are some trading ideas for the near term: Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Rail Vikas Nigam| CMP: Rs 607.4  The weekly timeframe chart of RVNL indicates an attempt at an upside breakout from its weekly range movement. The stock price is currently trying to break out decisively from a down-sloping trendline and a narrow range on the daily chart around Rs 600-610 levels. Volume has started to expand during this upside breakout, and the daily RSI (Relative Strength Index) shows a positive indication. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 665 Stop-Loss: Rs 570 Radico Khaitan: Rs 1,942  After moving into a larger high-low range over the last 4-5 months, Radico Khaitan's price is now attempting a decisive breakout of this range at Rs 1,880-1,900 levels. Following a sustainable upmove in the previous week, the stock has continued its upward momentum and closed above the hurdle. Volume has started to expand during this breakout, and the weekly RSI has moved above the crucial upper 60 level. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,155 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,870 Oberoi Realty| CMP: Rs 1,772  The consolidation movement of the past month in Oberoi Realty seems to be ending soon. The stock price is now on the verge of breaking above the upper band around Rs 1,800. It has been trading above the key lower support of the 20-week EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and has moved above the immediate resistance of the 10-week EMA for the past week. Volume and RSI patterns are indicating a positive bias for the stock price ahead. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,960 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,685 Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities Gujarat State Petronet| CMP: Rs 442.6  Since August 2021, Gujarat State Petronet (GSPL) has been consolidating within a ""Cup & Handle"" formation. With this month's 30 percent price hike, the stock has decisively broken out of the pattern at Rs 395 on a monthly closing basis. This breakout is accompanied by high volumes, indicating increased momentum. The stock has recently recaptured its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) and rebounded sharply, reconfirming a bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly ""Band Bollinger"" buy signals show increased momentum. The RSI across all time frames is in positive territory, justifying rising strength. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 485-585, with a downside support zone of Rs 410-390 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 485, Rs 585 Stop-Loss: Rs 410 Glenmark Pharmaceuticals| CMP: Rs 1,731.75  Glenmark is in a strong uptrend across all time frames, showing bullish sentiment. The stock is well above its 20, 50, 100, and 200-day SMA, which are also rising along with the price, reaffirming the bullish trend. The daily, weekly, and monthly RSI indicators are in positive territory, reflecting rising strength. The stock is trending higher in an ""up-sloping Channel,"" which supports sustained strength and trend. Investors should buy, hold, and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 1,800-1,885, with a downside support zone of Rs 1,675-1,575 levels. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,800, Rs 1,885 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,675 Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One UPL| CMP: Rs 598.35  On the weekly chart, UPL has confirmed a bullish reversal pattern known as the â€˜Inverse Head and Shoulders.â€™ This pattern was validated on Friday with strong volumes and a bullish candle, marking a breakaway gap. Additionally, the stock closed above the 89-week EMA, which had previously acted as significant resistance but now suggests a shift in polarity. The RSI on the weekly chart has also moved past the 60 mark, a level it has struggled to surpass for over 18 months, indicating a potential shift in momentum to the upside. Hence, we recommend buying UPL around Rs 598 - Rs 595. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 650 Stop-Loss: Rs 571 Home First Finance Company India| CMP: Rs 1,153  Following a sharp rise from Rs 770 to Rs 1,100 in June, prices entered a period of time-wise correction. However, they have now resumed their primary uptrend by breaking out of this congestion zone. Volume activity, which was subdued during the correction, has picked up, confirming the validity of the breakout. With the highest weekly closing recorded, we anticipate that the positive momentum will continue in the near term. Hence, we recommend buying Home First Finance Company around Rs 1,153 - Rs 1,145. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,250 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,098 Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Som Distilleries and Breweries| CMP: Rs 112.2  Som Distilleries reached a peak of approximately Rs 149 in May 2024.

This investment was way lower than Rs 32,365 crore in July and Rs 26,565 crore in June, according to data with the depositories. While September is likely to see continued interest from FPIs, the flows would be shaped by a combination of domestic political stability, economic indicators, global interest rate movements, market valuations, sectoral preferences, and the attractiveness of the debt market, Vipul Bhowar, Director Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors, said. According to the data with the depositories, Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) made a net investment of Rs 7,320 crore in Indian equities in August. The fundamental reason for the poor FPI interest compared to the preceding two months is the high valuation in the Indian market. With Nifty trading at above 20 times estimated FY25 earnings, India is the most expensive market in the world now. FPIs have opportunities to invest in much cheaper markets and, therefore, their priority is markets other than India, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said. Additionally, the unwinding of the Yen carry trade on August 24 significantly impacted FPI behaviour, leading to substantial sell off in Indian equities, Bhowar said. This unwinding coincided with rising fears of a potential recession in the US and disappointing economic data, which further exacerbated the marketâ€™s reaction, he added. Interestingly, FPIs have been selling in the secondary market, where valuations are perceived to be high, and redirecting their investments towards the primary market, which offers relatively lower valuations. Meanwhile, FPIs infused Rs 17,960 crore in the debt markets in August. Experts believe that inclusion in global bond indices, attractive interest rates, stable economic growth, shift from equities, and favourable long-term outlook have been the key factors driving FPIs to invest in debt. Investment in debt is led by index inclusion flows. It is since October last year when JP Morgan announced index inclusion, Vishad Turakhia, Managing Director at Equirus Securities, said. Indiaâ€™s inclusion in global bond indices and attractive yields have attracted flows, Nimesh Chandan, CIO, Bajaj Finserv Asset Management Ltd, said. Also, FPIs are buying in the debt market mainly because the Indian Rupee (INR) has been stable this year and this stability is expected to continue, Geojitâ€™s Vijayakumar said. With this FPIs investment in equities has reached Rs 42,885 crore and Rs 1.08 lakh crore in the debt market in 2024 so far. ",2024-09-01 11:08

According to him, some price or time correction in the short term can't be ruled out, but he maintains a positive long-term view of investments. On the sectors front, he prefers banks, power sector capital expenditure stocks, automotive and automotive components, select new-age businesses, electronics manufacturing, data center opportunities, and circular economy-related stocks, said Shailendra with more than two decades of experience in fund management and investment advisory. Do you think the market will not see major correction in the rest of financial year? Whether the market will experience a price correction or remain in a period of consolidation will hinge on forthcoming news developments. The Nifty index is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 23.5, which is at the upper bound of its typical trading range of 20-24. Simultaneously, corporate earnings during the recently concluded quarterly results season were lacklustre. In contrast to the previous two financial years, where Nifty earnings per share grew by more than 20 percent, expectations for FY25 now have been revised downwards to around 10 percent. Therefore, while the Indian market maintains a bullish trajectory in the long term, prudence dictates some caution in the short term. Do you see any big trigger for the market, apart from Fed? The outcome of the US election is significant as it will have a wider impact on most of the financial markets, currency, commodities, bonds, and equities. Another key factor to consider in the near term is the US employment data scheduled for September 6th. The sharp market drop in early August was a direct result of the surprisingly poor employment figures released last month. FED policy measures remain a big trigger for the short-term movement. While the July policy minutes maintained a bit of a hawkish tone, the market is expecting a cut of 25 to more hopeful 50bps cuts. Is it the time to add big exposure to banks? Where do you see the strong opportunity of investment - private banks or PSU banks? Over the past four years, bank stocks have lagged behind the overall market as other sectors have experienced stronger growth. However, banks remain solid investments, and their valuations are currently attractive. It's advisable to gradually accumulate banking stocks, with a preference for private banks. We prefer private banks as the valuation differential with PSU banks has narrowed. Also, a sharp fall in provisioning and write-backs for PSU banks is behind, and net profit growth now will be more in line with the business growth where Private banks continue to do better. Are you bullish on the power financing space as well as other segments in the power space? Capacity addition in the power sector till 2031-32 is expected to be around 4.4 lakh MWH resulting in a capex requirement of around Rs 26.66 lakh crore. This is highly positive for power financing companies. Power demand in India has continuously grown at 7 percent per annum and now demand almost matches the supply in the market requiring urgent capex both for the coal-based power plants as well as renewables. This means good business for equipment manufacturers for power plants and transmission networks too. Do you see moderation in earnings growth in the current financial year? The first quarter of fiscal year 2025 has signaled a deceleration in earnings growth. While the market is hopeful for a robust rebound in the second quarter, we maintain a cautious stance. Do you see any possibility of a slowdown in domestic liquidity? If not, then where do you want to bet on? Domestic liquidity remains healthy, and we foresee no major shifts. In addition, foreign institutional investors' interest in recent block deals suggests a possible return following a market correction. Although we expect some price or time correction, we maintain a positive long-term view of investments. Our current investment preferences include banks, power sector capital expenditure stocks, automotive and automotive components, select new-age businesses, electronics manufacturing, data center opportunities, and circular economy-related stocks.

Despite major correction in the beginning, the August month, too, closed higher with over a percent gains, continuing uptrend for third consecutive month. Moody's upgradedIndiaâ€™s GDP rating forecast(to 7.2 percent for 2024 and 6.6 percent for 2025 from earlier estimates of 6.8 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively), citing strong broad-based growth and healthy MSCI inflow, which also boosted market sentiment. On Monday, the market will first react to Q1 GDP numbers announced last Friday and auto sales data from some companies over the weekend. Overall, according to experts, the sentiment may remain positive despite likely intermittent consolidation and fresh highs can't be ruled out next week, with a focus on the global macro data and PMI numbers. During the last week, the BSE Sensex rallied 1.58 percent or 1,280 points to 82,366, and the Nifty 50 climbed 1.66 percent or 413 points to 25,236, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.25 percent, and 1.19 percent, respectively. ""We expect the market to continue its northbound journey with stock-specific action,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said. According to him, global macro data released during the week will continue to provide cues to domestic equities. Here are 10 key factors to watch: US Unemployment Rate Globally investors will focus majorly on several economic data points from the US including the unemployment rate, non-farm payrolls, monthly vehicle sales for August; weekly jobs data; and JOLTs job openings & quits, and factory orders for July, which will influence the market sentiment. All these data will be important especially ahead of the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting, wherein as per most experts, the central bank may announce a first rate cut. In July, the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3 percent, from 4.1 percent in the previous month. Global Economic Data Apart from the US economic data, the manufacturing and services PMI numbers from several developed and developing nations, as well as the third estimates for Europe's June quarter GDP will be watched.  Domestic Economic Data On the domestic front, the market participants will keep an eye on the final HSBC Manufacturing and Services PMI numbers for August, releasing on September 2, and September 4, respectively. As per the Flash data, Manufacturing PMI dropped to 57.9 in August, from 58.1 in the previous month, while Services PMI increased to 60.4, from 60.3 during the same period In addition, bank loan & deposit growth for the fortnight ended August 23, and foreign exchange reserves for week ended August 30 will also be announced next week on September 6. Auto Stocks Auto stocks will be in focus in the initial part of the next week as automobile companies started releasing their August sales numbers from September 1. FII & DII Flow The activity at the FIIs and DIIs' desks is another factor to watch in the coming week. Finally, foreign institutional investors turned net buyers in the equity cash segment (as per provisional data) after being sellers in the previous several weeks, which may have provided good support to the market to hit fresh record highs, although domestic institutional investors preferred to book some profits at highs. FIIs net bought Rs 9,217 crore worth of shares during the passing week, which resulted into a reduction in their net selling for August month to Rs 21,369 crore. DIIs remained buyers, pumping in Rs 1,198 crore in the week (although the inflow was low compared to previous weeks) and Rs 48,279 crore in August. IPO In the primary market, the mainboard segment will not see major action as Gala Precision Engineering is the only IPO from the segment, opening next week on September 2 to raise Rs 168 crore, while Premier Energies will be the first listing on the bourses next week on September 3, followed by Ecos India Mobility & Hospitality on September 4. In addition, Baazar Style Retail's 835-crore public issue will close on September 3 and the trading in its equity shares will commence effective 6.

Travels & Rentals will debut on the BSE SME on September 5, followed by Boss Packaging Solutions shares on the NSE Emerge on September 6. Technical View Technically, the Nifty 50 formed a Doji-like pattern on the daily charts, and on the weekly timeframe, the index recorded a long bullish candlestick pattern, with the continuation of higher highs-higher lows formation, and positive bias in momentum indicators. Hence, the upward journey is likely to continue withÂ a focus on the 25,400-25,500 levels next week but the intermittent consolidation can't be ruled out with immediate support of 25,000, with 24,800 being crucial support, according to experts. F&O Cues The weekly options data indicated that the 25,700-25,800 are the next levels to watch on the higher side, with support at 25,000 in coming sessions. On the Call side, the maximum open interest was seen at 26,000 strikes, followed by the 26,500 and 25,700 strikes, with maximum writing at the 25,800 strikes, and then the 26,500 and 25,700 strikes. On the Put site, the 25,000 strike holds the maximum open interest, followed by the 25,200 and 24,000 strikes, with the maximum writing at the 25,200 strikes, and then the 25,000 and 25,300 strikes. India VIX The volatility remained on the lower side for the third consecutive week and sustained below all key moving averages during the week, which is favourable for bulls to hold the fort. Until it stays below the 15 mark, the charge may remain at the bull's desk, experts feel. The India VIX, the fear index, dropped 1.18 percent to 13.39, from 13.55 levels on a week-on-week basis.

The rolloverÂ of Nifty Index futures was higher at 77.49 percent in August, compared to the previous month's 69.69 percent and the three-month average of 74.50 percent, indicating that long positions are being rolled over given the confidence in the bullish momentum, according to Shah. Shah is bullish on two Nifty 50 stocksÂ â€” LTIMindtree and Bajaj Finserv. ""The former has recently broken out of a consolidation phase, and the latter hasÂ displayed a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the weekly chart. This breakout is backed by volumes,"" said the Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI SecuritiesÂ with over 17 years of experience. Will Nifty hit 26,000 in the September series? What is your take on the rollover data? In August, the Nifty experienced significant volatility, with 12 trading sessions opening either with a major gap upÂ orÂ gap down. Throughout the month, it fluctuated within a 1,300-point range, underscoring heightened market volatility. Despite this, the index reached new all-time highs and closed the month above theÂ  psychological level of 25,200. Notably, the index ended on a positiveÂ note for the third consecutive month. On a monthly scale, it has formed a bullish candle with a long lower shadow, indicating buying interest at lower levels. The rolloverÂ of Nifty Index futures was higher at 77.49 percent in August, compared to the previous month's 69.69 percent and the three-month average of 74.50 percent, indicating that long positions are being rolled over given the confidence in the bullish momentum. Steady sector rotation has played a crucial role in supporting the market and maintaining these elevated levels. During the month, Nifty IT, Nifty Pharma, and Nifty Healthcare have strongly outperformed frontline indices. We believe these sectors are likely to continue their northward journey in the next couple of trading sessions. Coming back to the Nifty, on Thursday, the index hasÂ demonstrated a horizontal trendline breakout on a daily scale, which is a bullish sign. The momentum indicators and oscillators are also supporting the overall bullish chart structure. The daily and weekly RSIs (Relative Strength Index)Â are highly bullish per the RSI range shift theory. The daily MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) histogram is suggesting a pickup in upside momentum. In terms ofÂ levels, the index is likely to test 25,700, followed by 26,000 in the short term. On the downside, the support has shifted higher to the 24,900-24,850 zone. Do you think the Bank Nifty has just started its upward journey towards a record high after days of consolidation? For the second consecutive month, the Bank Nifty has lagged the frontline indices. While Nifty is reaching new all-time highs, the Bank Nifty remains nearly 4Â percent below its peak, formed in July. This disparity highlights the ongoing underperformance of the Bank Nifty relative to the broader market. Notably, the ratio chart of Bank Nifty compared to Nifty is at a 200-week low,Â and is in a falling mode. However, the index has recently formed a strong base near its 100-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) level andÂ  gradually started hitting higher highs and higher lows. Going forward, the 51,400-51,500 zone willÂ be a crucial hurdle for the index. Any sustainable move above 51,500 will likely lead to a sharp upside rally up to 52,200, followed by 52,800 in the short term. On the downside, the 51,000-50,900 zone will act as crucial support. If the indexÂ slips below 50,900, the next support is at 50,500-50,400. Is it the right time to take a position in pharma stocks given the uptrend in the pharma index? According to a simple trend analysis and the Dow Theory, the index is in a confirmed uptrend as it has marked higher tops and higher bottoms on daily and weekly charts. The uptrend remains intact as long as the sequence of higher tops and higher bottoms is maintained. However, momentum indicators and oscillators are painting a different picture. The weekly and daily RSIsÂ are in the extremely overbought zone. Additionally, the daily and weekly Stochastic indicators are also suggesting overbought conditions for the index. These technical factors indicate that the index may enter a period of consolidation before hitting a higher high. Talking about levels, the 22,700-22,600 zone will act as immediate support for the index. As long as the index trades above 22,600, it is likely to trade with a positive bias. Whatâ€™s your take onAU Small Finance Bank, which has seen a trendline breakout? AU Small Finance Bank's stock has broken out of a Falling Wedge pattern on the daily chart, confirmed by trading volumes exceeding the 50-day average. A robust bullish candle formed on the breakout day further validates this upward momentum. The stock has also surged above its 200-day EMA, reinforcing the bullish outlook. The daily RSI has broken through a downward sloping trendline, signalling strong bullish momentum. Additionally, the MACD histogram indicates an increase in upside momentum, further supporting the positive trend. Looking ahead, the stock is expected to continue its upward trajectory, potentially reaching Rs 740 in the short term, with an extended target of Rs 785. On the downside, the Rs 650-640 zone is expected to provide immediate support. Are you betting onPaytmafter reading the charts? On the weekly chart, Paytm's stock has recently broken out of an Adam and Adam Double Bottom patternâ€™s neckline, signalling a bullish reversal. Following this breakout, the stock has been forming a series of higher highs and higher lows on the daily charts, supported by strong trading volumes. Currently, the stock is trading above both its short and long-term moving averages, which are beginning to trend upward â€” a positive sign for further gains. Notably, the weekly RSI has climbed above the 60 mark for the first time since October 2023, underscoring the strengthening bullish momentum. Looking ahead, Paytm's stock is poised to test Rs 660, with a potential move toward Rs 750 in the short term. On the downside, Rs 560-540Â  will serve as crucial support. Your topÂ twoÂ stock picks for September? LTIMindtree Nifty IT has been strongly outperforming frontline indices over the past few trading sessions, and LTIMindtree's stock has recently broken out of a consolidation phase on the weekly charts. This breakout is backed by volumes exceeding the 50-week average and is reinforced by a sizeable bullish candle formed during the breakout week. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages, with momentum indicators and oscillators also supporting the bullish outlook. Given these positive technical signals, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 6,150-6,100 zone, withÂ the stop-loss at Rs 5,880. On the upside, the stock is likely to testÂ  Rs 6,500,Â and potentiallyÂ hitÂ Rs 6,750 in the medium term. BajajFinserv On a weekly scale, the stock has recently given a Symmetrical Triangle breakout, confirmed by robust volume. Additionally, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle on the breakout week, adding strength to the breakout. The momentum indicators are also suggesting strong bullishness in the stock. The daily and weekly RSIs are highlyÂ bullish. Most notably, the weekly RSI has surged above the 60 mark for the first time in CY 2024. Furthermore, the daily MACD histogram is suggesting a pickup in upside momentum. These technical factors are aligned in favour of the bulls. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the Rs 1,785-1,765 range withÂ the stop-loss at Rs 1,680. On the upside, it is likely to test Rs 1,900, followed by Rs 1,960 in the short term.

Dollar swung between gains and losses last week but managed to close with a 1 percent upside near 101.8 levels as moderating inflation in the US reinforced the view that Fed is likely to implement a modest 25 bps rate cut in September. US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) held steady at 2.5 percent year-over-year in July in line with estimates, Core gauge was slightly lower than expected at 2.6 percent. Also, consumer spending, key driver of the US economic growth, grew by 0.5 percent in July, hinting towards continued resilience early in the third quarter following a 3 percent annualized growth rate in the second quarter. Still, dollar closed August down 2.2 percent, marking its biggest monthly decline of the year. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones both posted their fourth consecutive monthly gain, supported by easing concerns of a US recession. Comex gold closed the week 0.5 percent lower at $2536 per troy ounce retreating sharply from $2560 per troy ounce on Friday as resilient consumer spending, cooling inflation and better-than-expected GDP growth reduced likelihood of a more aggressive easing. Gold prices had surged to $2564 per troy ounce earlier in the week buoyed by weaker dollar and safe haven bids. Comex silver closed the week 2 percent lower pulling back from $30 per troy ounce owing to sharp rebound in dollar and weakness in gold prices. LME base metals too erased all the gains made earlier and closed the week lower weighed down further by growing concerns that China might not meet its 5 percent growth target for 2024. Despite this, metals closed August on a positive buoyed by hopes of soft landing in the US and rising expectations of a Fed Pivot. WTI crude tumbled below $74 per barrel and closed the second consecutive month on a weaker note, as reports of OPEC+ planned output hike from October and demand concerns from China, worldâ€™s top importer, far outweighed supply disruptions from Libya and planned output cuts by Iraq. Libyaâ€™s National Oil Corporation reported a drop of 1.5 million barrels in output and a $120 million revenue loss from August 26 to 28 due to force majeure. Oil prices may continue to be volatile as markets weigh the potential impact of further drop in Libyan output against OPEC+ supply adjustments. On the daily chart, MCX Crude Oil (September Futures) witnessed resistance near its 200 period â€˜Simple Moving Averageâ€™ hovering around Rs 6,496 (dynamic resistance). Also, price has breached below its â€˜Bollinger Band Meanâ€™ confirming weakness. Next support for the counter is placed at Rs 6,000, below which major support is placed at Rs 5,850. Next week starting from September 2, investors will be keenly focused on the US labour report, which is expected to be a critical indicator for assessing recession risks. A weaker-than-expected jobs report could dampen market sentiment and intensify calls for the Federal Reserve to implement a 50 basis point rate cut. While a better-than-expected report might not provoke a significant reaction as it doesnâ€™t alter current rate cut expectations. Metals and crude oil may face a challenging start, as Chinaâ€™s manufacturing PMI contracted for the fourth consecutive month in August, indicating weak economic momentum and fuelling calls for fresh stimulus.

This marks a strong beginning to the September series. The Nifty 50 may experience some consolidation before advancing towards 25,400, with 25,000 serving as support. Meanwhile, the Bank Nifty needs to close and sustain above 51,500 for further progress towards 52,000; until then, consolidation will continue with 51,000 as support, according to experts. On Friday, the Nifty 50 rose by 84 points to 25,236, and the Bank Nifty jumped 198 points to 51,351. On the NSE, 1,366 shares advanced, while 985 shares declined. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities The Nifty closed with a gain of 413 points on a weekly basis. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a bullish candle, creating a higher high and higher low compared to the previous week, and has closed above the previous swing high, indicating a positive bias. The chart pattern suggests that if the Nifty crosses and sustains above the 25,350 level, it could see buying, leading the index towards 25,500-25,700 levels. However, if the index breaks below the 25,100 level, it could experience selling, potentially moving towards 25,000-24,800. For the week, we expect the Nifty to trade in the range of 25,700-24,800 with a positive bias. The weekly strength indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is above its respective reference lines, indicating a positive bias. Key Resistance: 25,350, 25,500 Key Support: 25,100, 24,900 Strategy: Buy the Nifty around 25,100 with a stop-loss at 25,000 and a target of 25,350-25,450. Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One The August price action formed a ""Saucer"" pattern, indicating further potential for an upmove in the near term. The reciprocal retracement of the August decline points to near-term targets of 25,400 and 25,500. During last week's upmove, the Nifty 50 left behind a couple of bullish gapsâ€”one on Monday around 24,850 and another on Friday near 25,200. The Monday gap is particularly significant, as it also appears on the weekly chart, suggesting that any dip towards this level is likely to be bought into. Before that, the previous swing high around 25,080 could act as immediate support. However, the next leg of the move may not be as smooth as recent trends. Given the positive momentum throughout the week, the support base has shifted higher. The highest open interest is now at the ATM (at-the-money) strike of 25,200 Put, followed by the 25,000 Put, suggesting strong nearby support and a positive market bias, with buying interest on any minor dips. Conversely, resistance is expected in the 25,500â€“25,700 range, with significant open interest in the Call options for the first week of the September series. Key Resistance: 25,400, 25,500, 25,580 Key Support: 25,080, 25,000, 24,850 Strategy: Traders are advised to avoid complacency, be selective, use dips as buying opportunities, and book profits at higher levels to avoid potential setbacks amidst market volatility. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities Technically, Friday's price action indicates the formation of a Doji-type candle pattern at the new highs. Normally, such Doji formations at new highs alert for trend reversals, but recent Doji formations have failed to result in significant reversals in the market. The short-term trend of the Nifty remains positive, but the market is not gathering sharp upside momentum into new highs. One may expect further consolidation or a minor dip from near the resistance of 25,300â€“25,400 levels. Immediate support is at 25,100. Key Resistance: 25,400, 25,800 Key Support: 25,100, 24,800 Strategy: Buy the Nifty around 25,150-25,100, with a stop-loss at 24,900, and a target of 25,400. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Rajesh Palviya, Senior Vice President Research (Head Technical Derivatives) at Axis Securities The Bank Nifty closed with a gain of 418 points on a weekly basis. On the weekly chart, the index has formed a small bullish candle with shadows on either side, indicating indecisiveness among participants regarding the direction. The chart pattern suggests that if the Bank Nifty crosses and sustains above the 51,500 level, it could see buying, leading the index towards 51,750-52,000 levels. However, if the index breaks below the 51,000 level, it could experience selling, potentially moving towards 50,800-50,600. For the week starting September 2, we expect the Bank Nifty to trade in the range of 52,000-50,600 with a mixed bias. The weekly strength indicator RSI remains flat, indicating the absence of strength. However, the momentum oscillator Stochastic has turned positive from the oversold zone, suggesting a possible upmove in the near term. Key Resistance: 51,500, 51,750 Key Support: 51,100, 50,900 Strategy: Buy the Bank Nifty near 51,200 with a stop-loss at 51,000 and a target of 51,500-51,650. Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One The Bank Nifty continued to lag behind the broader markets, staying within a range for most of the last week. Currently, the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) on the daily chart around 50,800 serves as immediate support, while 51,500 acts as resistance. A breakout above this range could trigger renewed momentum. Minimal activity was observed on the option chain front, with significant open interest noted at the ATM 51,400-51,500 Call strikes, with a sustained move beyond these levels needed to trigger momentum. On the downside, the 51,000 Put has the highest open interest, indicating support. Key Resistance: 51,500, 52,000, 52,250 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800, 50,500 Strategy: The high beta index lacks significant traction. It is advisable to wait for a breakout to focus on potential momentum gains. Until then, dips could be bought if the support levels of 50,800-51,000 hold. Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities The immediate hurdle of 51,200, which was a previous opening down gap, has been filled on the upside, and the hurdle of the weekly 20-period EMA has also been surpassed as per the weekly chart. The bullish chart pattern, such as higher highs and lows, remains intact.

He explained that pricing discussions have become more straightforward as companies seek to deliver returns to investors while managing new capital..Related stories.","Once companies come to us for an IPO, they have already traversed significant ground and often faced multiple near-death experiences, said Abhishek Bhagat, Managing Director,Digital & Technology Investment Banking, JM Financial Ltd. Bhagat was a part of a panel during the Global Fintech Fest where he was highlighting the criteria for picking companies to go public. He added that while growth remains a fundamental criterion, profitability has become increasingly significant. ""We look at how the company is projected to perform over the next 8 to 12 quarters and whether it can meet those predictions,"" he explained. ""Howâ€™s the profitability looking? That's increasingly important in today's market scenario."" are the questions they ask, he said. Governance is another critical factor. BhagatÂ said, ""We assess the overall governance framework and corporate governance structure that the company has or aims to establish."" HeÂ said that their involvement often starts early, assisting companies in setting up necessary frameworks well before the IPO. ""Sometimes, we engage with companies 12 months before the IPO and help them establish these processes,"" he said. He also discussed market position and potential competitive threats. ""Are there any likely competitive threats that could make the business unviable?"" he asked. Bhagat addedÂ that while regulatory issues, particularly in sectors like FinTech, are a consideration, they are generally manageable. ""Regulatory overhang could be slightly more than others, but it's not a major obstacle,"" he said. On market trends, Bhagat said, ""Today, companies are evaluated on profit multiples rather than just revenue multiples. Investors are now tracking profitability more closely, even if it's projected for two years out."" He added that there is a shift from the earlier focus on revenue, a ""more nuanced understanding of valuation"". OnÂ pricing and dilution, Bhagat said, ""Most founders and investors have realized that the dilution is typically between 10 to 20 percent,"" he said. He explained that pricing discussions have become more straightforward as companies seek to deliver returns to investors while managing new capital. ""Markets are a lot more mature now,"" Bhagat said. ""Itâ€™s encouraging for investors as it suggests we might find more attractive opportunities, even though they are still scarce."" He added that the combination of experienced investors and more refined market conditions is creating a more favorable environment for both new public companies and their investors. He also added that despite the challenges, I remain optimistic about finding compelling investment opportunities in this evolving market. ",2024-08-31 16:00

However, to expect players to commit to capex in the sector, there shall have to be the promise of returns, he added. In an exclusive conversation withMoneycontrol, Scindia said that while telcos are implementing higher tariff, the hike has been miniscule compared to historic highs seen by the sector in the past. The Minister toldMoneycontrol'sManaging Editor Nalin Mehta along with Shweta Punj in this exclusive conversation, that the Made in India 4G Stack can emerge as a global alternative to what Chinese players are providing. Here's the edited excerpt ofMoneycontrol'sinteraction with the Union Communication Minister. Nalin Mehta:ÂWe are delighted to be joined today by the Minister for Communications and North-East, also a leading light of the Modi cabinet, and an MP from Guna - Mr Jyotiraditya Scindia. Sir, thank you very much for taking the time. In this tenure as Minister, youâ€™ve talked about the goal of Bharat as a telecom superpower. Youâ€™ve met with the stakeholders recently, set up committees. Tell us a little bit about what your vision for the Ministry is now, and for telecom sector? What kind of targets you've set and what kind of reforms can we expect? Also Read:The India Stack an alternative to Chinese tech? Jyotiraditya Scindia:ÂLet me start by saying that telecom is an integral part of any country's growth potential today in the world. Telecom is not no longer only a means of communication, but it's a means of education. It's a means of garnering information, and information equals knowledge, equals IP, equals innovation, equals success. Therefore, telecom has become an integral part of, as I mentioned, any countryâ€™s growth story. India has leapfrogged to that extent in the last decade under Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s leadership, whether you look at mobile connectivity, where penetration has grown to close to 85% with 116 crore mobile subscribers, whether you look at internet connectivity which has grown from a low base of 20 crore to almost 95 crore, with 67% penetration rate. At the same time, the economies of scale argument has come into place where, when revenues rise and cost of service falls. If you look at telecom rates, which were roughly at 0.51 paise per minute in 2014, today it is 0.03 paise per minute. So, it has got slashed by 96%. The same holds good for internet connectivity, where 1 GB of internet connectivity used to cost Rs 287, it now costs Rs 9, down by 94%. Having said that, I think it's important for India to ensure a couple of things. First, the Prime Minister's imperative that we need to be atmanirbhar, if indeed we are going to translate our goal of Viksit Bharat into reality, then India must be atmanirbhar, i.e. must produce its own equipment and technology. Therefore this insistence, at least with the government-owned telecom service provider - the BSNL. We have now got our own 4G technology â€“the third country in the world to have its own 4G stack. Which means, not only the core, but also the Radio Access Network (RAN), along with BTSes (base transceiver station), combined with data centers is in the process of being rolled today for BSNL. And it'sâ€™ been a Herculean effort. I must commend all the organizations that have worked together with one goal, one vision and one plan to make that happen. The technology and the Proof of Concept has been proven, we are now moving ahead. TCS along with C-DOT and Tejas and BSNL are working together in a project management unit to roll that out. We have a target of rolling out one lakh BTS (base transceiver station) towers over the next six months to a year, to be able to have 4G penetration. So, that is one of the very key goals. The second is 4G saturation. In our country, we need to ensure that the access to information goes down to the last village, and that too has been the prime minister's imperative. Whatever we do, we must do with saturation. And so there are 52,000-odd towers that still need to be erected across 10,000 villages in India. This is not limited to the government company, it's across all TSPs. All four TSPs are working assiduously at that, something that I'm monitoring on a daily basis. Along with that is the PLI. It's important for India to become â€“ we are already the mobile phone manufacturer of the world, but I think it's important to also become telecom equipment manufacturer of the world. And for that, we launched the PLI scheme which is paying rich dividends. We need to ensure proliferation and greater adoption of that happens, both in terms of equipment manufacturing and equipment R&D. So, that would also be one of the things that I would look at, as an imperative. Finally, the Telecommunication Act was passed by Parliament last December. We have put it through the Gazette notification route this June, which gives us a window of 180 days to make sure that all the rules are out there, 23 sections and 35 rules that need to be pushed out, and we are monitoring that. I am also responsible, most importantly, to my customers, and the Telecom Ministry must make sure that we have quality of service in place for customers, i.e., no call drops, no intermittent issues with regard to communication on mobile phones, as well as to reduce the number of spam calls and fraud calls. TRAI has already passed a regulation to that effect in the last days 15-20 days, and we must see execution of that. Also Read:ÂGovt won't interfere in Vodafone Idea's affairs, says Telecom Minister Scindia Shweta Punj:Mr. Scindia, you have a daunting task. As you mentioned that you are answerable to the customers of India. We have seen telecom market shrink substantially. From a whole host of players, weâ€™re now down to three big players. Is that a situation youâ€™re comfortable with, because ultimately consumers must have choice. You also mentioned about telecom tariffs which are low, but we have seen tariff hikes come in recently. Jyotiraditya Scindia:ÂThank you for your question, Shweta. But I think it's important thatMoneycontrolalso does deep dive in terms of what has happened already, prior to looking at what's happening in the Indian market. We have four players in the Indian market today, and if you look at any country in the world today, I would dare say that no country in the world has more than 2-3 players. So, we are very comfortably placed in terms of the number of players. We have got to look at how the global industry telecom is working when we look at the perspective of how Indian industry is working. The answer to your first question is we have enough players in India. Four players is a decent number of players compared to what the world is looking like, on a country wide-basis. Your second question is with regard to tariffs. There are three or four things that are at play here. If you compare the rate of a package in India, which, if you look at 70 SMSes, 2GB of data, plus a number of calls, then India is priced at roughly about $1.89 for that package. The US is priced at $40, developed countries somewhere between $12 to $35, while developing countries are priced upwards of $9. So, suffice to say that we are the cheapest in the world. In the last 10 years, tariff for voice calls have fallen by 97%, from 0.53 paise to 0.03 paise. Data costs have fallen by 94%, Rs 287 per GB to Rs 9 per GB. So, you have a declining cost structure for consumers over a decadal period. On the other side, you had the fastest rollout of 5G in the world happening in India. Started in October â€™22, and in 21 months weâ€™ve rolled out for 5G across the country. You've got 4.5 lakh BTSes that have been set up for 5G. What does that mean? That means that telcos have gone through a capex plan of Rs 4.26 lakh crore over the last two years. The last tariff hike was three years ago, right? This year there has been an 11% tariff hike. What does that mean? That means that your cost per minute has gone up from 0.03 paise to 0.033 paise. Your data cost has gone up from Rs 9 per GB to Rs 9.9 per GB, when it used to be Rs 287 per GB. So, if we are expecting companies, whether government or private sector, putting in that amount of capex, there has to be a return for it. You've seen declining costs over a decadal period, and the last tariff being imposed three years ago - prior to 5G being rolled out - and a Rs 4.26 lakh crore capex cost. Being Moneycontrol, I'm sure you understand the economics of that argument. Also Read:ÂIndia's telecom tech to provide alternative option to world: Scindia Nalin Mehta:On the first point you have made about the India stack, a number of countries must be in touch with India to use some of this indigenous technology. How do you see that happening, and also do you see this India Stack as an alternative to the Chinese technologies around the world? Jyotiraditya Scindia:Absolutely. I think if we successfully roll this out - and I would wait until mid of next year - we've got 22,000 towers that have already been put up. Our core network is working across all four centers, and our data centers are up and running. So, we already have live customers on 4G as we speak. It's no longer a proof of concept, it's actually in execution as we speak. And, when we roll out our one lakh BTSes, then I'm very, very confident that this is going to be an alternative technology. There are only three countries in the world that have this technology, and India is going to be one of them. Let me also add, in terms of the question that youâ€™ve not raised, that the movement from a 4G to a 5G technology is only going to be incremental from this 4G technology. The 4G core can be used for 5G as well. The only change that youâ€™ll probably need to bring about is adding a couple of BTSSs on to the towers. So it's going to be just incremental and a not a monumental change to switch from 4G to 5G. However, we'd like to first make sure that 4G is stable and running well. Shweta Punj:We recently had the 5G spectrum auctions and the response was not as encouraging as one would have hoped. Any analysis on what really happened? And since this is the last question, we also want to get a sense from you on BSNL and Vodafone Idea. Jyotiraditya Scindia:ÂLet me take the first question. I think the auction was tremendously successful, let me explain why. We had eight bands of spectrum that were put out, and we had auction bids came in for four bands of spectrum. Please do also understand that this is on the back of very large spectrum auction that took place in 2022-23 where we sold spectrum worth almost Rs 1.5 lakh crore, and that was for 4G, 5G technology. So this round of auction was mainly for those whose spectrum was expiring and they required more spectrum. The 5G bids that went in mainly were for 3300 Megahertz to 26 Gigahertz spectrum, which were taken up last time. Of the total 10,500 Megahertz that we put up for auction, this time, across the eight bands, close to about 9,900 Megahertz was in the 26 Gigahertz and 3,000 Megahertz spectrum which is for 5G. So, actually, what you're putting up for auction was only 531 Megahertz, and we sold 141 of that. So, we almost sold close to 30-35% of what we put up for auction, and we garnered Rs 10,000 crore out of that. Let me give you the breakup. The renewal part of the spectrum across the major players was about 40-45% of that 141 Megahertz that got sold, and the balance 60% was for additional spectrum that they took to service their needs on those spectrum bands which were different from the 5G spectrum bands. So, it was a very successful auction, I would say. Regarding Vodafone Idea, it has got its own professional management. Therefore, what happens in the financial and operational workings of a company is their business and not our business as a ministry. As far as BSNL is concerned, we are EBITDA positive. We would like to see the rollout of 4G. Number one, good execution. Number two, quality of service and customer satisfaction ratings increasing for our customers. And if you're able to do both of those, profits will accrue from that time. Please remember that in life, your notion and your thinking should never be bottom line alone, it should be satisfaction of customers. If you're going to satisfy the customers, the bottom line will come. That's theory number one of business. Our concentration right now is to execute 4G. Nalin Mehta:And finally, as a stakeholder in Vodafone Idea, any thoughts on increasing or decreasing the stake? Jyotiraditya Scindia:As I mentioned, it is the management of the company that has to decide what practice to follow. We would like a competitive telecom sector and the Ministry of Telecom would like, at the end of the day, the best quality service and choice to customers.

One such window of opportunity in Options trading is presented by trading Option Combinations comprising of Ratios. Ratios are not so widely used and discussed due to its incremental legs, in other words requirement of execution of 3 trades to take position in one underlying. Still they have a specific time and place where nothing else would work as effectively as Ratios. We will understand what are these ratios and the correct time and place to get the most Convenience out of them Responsibly one by one. #1 Ratio Spreads:Let us first discuss the Ratio Spreads with one Buy position coupled with multiple Sell positions in Option. Typically, a Call Ratio Spread would involve Buying a Call Option with strike close to the current market price and Selling 2 Lots of at least 2 steps higher Strike Call Options. Similarly, a Put Ratio spread would involve buying near CMP Put strike and selling 2 lots of at least 2 steps lower Put options. The obvious threat here is the additional selling which is done. It brings in a threat of losing out on super performance in our favor due to the additional option sold. But as I said there is a time and place that would require a solution like this. Meaning, that the last 5-7 sessions of the expiry are when the time value decay is at its highest and that is where the single options bought might actually be outdone in terms of stock price sensitivity by the time value decay. Hereâ€™s where we should deploy Ratios starting from last Friday of the expiry. Quite possibly even if it takes a couple of sessions a two-strike-apart ratio would let one have profits when the stock reaches the sold strike. Convenience: This trade would give a lot of advantage against the peril of Time Value Decay. The stop loss would be minuscule and given time would outperform single Call. Responsibility: The exit strategy should be tightly executed especially the Booking of Profits or it could turn ugly. #2 Back Ratio Spreads:This is actually the other way around where one would Sell the Call or Put close to the current market price of the underlying and Buy 2 Lots of Higher Call/ Lower Put. This is the trade that comes into play when we have a long month ahead of us and the premiums are fat. The situation requires us to have movement of large proportions in a few days. The issue with these movements is a Single Option with Fat premium would impose a large loss, while the Back Ratio would have a compounding impact of 2 Options doing the one Short Option. The best execution of this trade is when we have some sort of event-led excitement expected in the underlying in the Beginning of the expiry Convenience: If there is a big move in favor we make money while if things do not work out and no matter how lethal is unfavorable move the losses are super small or at times there could be a profit from a huge unfavorable move.

A bulk of the share sale happened during the final one hour, with nearly 20 crore shares sold after 2.30 pm. August 30Â wasÂ the due date of MSCI indices August rebalancing. Earlier, this month, global indices provider MSCI had raisedÂ the 'Foreign Inclusion Factor' for HDFC Bank stock from 0.37 to 0.56, opening up room for more foreign buying in the counter. HDFC Bankshare price fell following the share sale, giving up the day's gain. TheÂ stock was trading at Rs 1,630.25 near the closing bell, down 0.51 percent from the previous close. MSCI, in its periodic review, partially raised the foreign inclusion factor on HDFC Bank stock. It is set to further raise the FIF in another tranche in its next review in November. Juneâ€™s shareholding data showed that the foreign ownership in HDFC Bank stood at 54.83 percent, falling below the crucial 55 percent-mark, qualifying it for the increased MSCI weight during the August 2024 rebalancing. This level of foreign ownership allows for more than 25 percent â€˜foreign roomâ€™ in HDFC Bank, a requirement for MSCI to consider the stock at its full market-cap weight. Some analysts expectÂ theÂ full inclusion in MSCI post November review to eventually draw in as much as $5 billion of foreign inflows into HDFC Bank stock. Even at the partial raise, which is effective from August review, would likely bring in as much as $1.8 billion (~Rs 15,000 crore) worth of foreign buying in India's largest private bank. It be noted thatÂ theÂ final MSCI adjustment in HDFC Bank to raise the Foreign Inclusion Factor to 1 will occur in November, contingent on HDFC Bankâ€™s FPI headroom staying above 20 percent.

Since the real GDP growth of 6.7 percent in Q1, FY25 is lower than the 7.1 percent pencilled in by the Monetary Policy Committee, or the 7.4 percent estimated by the RBI researchers in their State of the Economy report, or even the 7 percent median estimate of RBIŌĆÖs professional forecastersŌĆÖ panel, does it mean that the RBI may reconsider its obsession with getting inflation down to 4 percent and focus more on growth? Not really, because growth in real Gross Value Added (GVA) in Q1 is much higher, at 6.8 percent, than the median estimate of 6.4 percent by RBIŌĆÖs professional forecasters. WhatŌĆÖs more, private consumption has shown year-on-year growth of 7.5 percent, a welcome change from the tepid growth in earlier quarters. ThatŌĆÖs a big improvement from the 4 percent growth in Q4, FY24 and it shows that consumption is finally trickling down to the masses and is becoming more broad-based. ThatŌĆÖs not all. Despite widespread fears of a slowdown in capex due to the elections, gross fixed capital formation growth was 7.5 percent in Q1 FY25, compared to 6.5 percent in the previous quarter. Private capex therefore must have picked up. GDP has been pulled down in Q1 as a result of the drag from net exports of goods and services on the one hand, and lower government consumption expenditure on the other. GVA growth in the agriculture and allied sectors is 2 percent in Q1, compared to 0.6 percent in the previous quarter. Growth in construction is very strong, at 10.5 percent y-o-y. Growth in the trade, transportation, communications sector has also picked up. Both agriculture as well as construction and trade and transport are sectors that provide a lot of jobs for the masses. Stronger growth in these sectors therefore augur well for the growth of consumer demand. The growth in construction and trade and transport is particularly commendable because they have come on top of high growth in the year ago quarter. Growth in manufacturing slowed down in Q1, FY 25, but that is mainly on account of higher growth in the year ago quarterŌĆöan unfavourable base effect. We had pointed outherethat if consumption growth is strong, it will lead to further corporate capex, while the central government has already in itsbudgetannounced its intention of pushing its capex.Fitch Ratings too has pointed out┬Āthat the key risk to growth is if the private investment cycle does not pick up as a result of subdued consumption, which would weigh on job creation. The Q1, FY 25 GDP/GVA data have provided much comfort on that front. Also, as ourMonsoon Watch┬Ācolumn said, the monsoons so far have been relatively good, which should keep inflation in check, thereby aiding consumption demand. US GDP growth too has been good, coming in at an annual rate of 3 percent in the June quarter, beating estimates and well ahead of a tepid 1.4 percent growth in Q1. Consumption spending rose at a 2.9 percent annual rate. That indicates the US economy is far from weak. That should reinforce thesoft landing narrative. PerhapsJerome PowellŌĆÖs well-telegraphed September rate cut┬Āis a pre-emptive measure, rather than a reaction. The regime change at the Fed, from tightening to loosening, will be accompanied by a regime change in the US markets, seen from the topping out of the Nvidia share and the abating of some of the AI frenzy. Asthis FT story, free to read for Moneycontrol Pro shareholders, said, ŌĆśŌĆÖThe regime change has been under way since Nvidia peaked on June 18. Since then, tech has been a drag on the broader market, while falling interest rate plays like real estate, utilities and financials, as well as defensives such as healthcare and consumer staples, have stood out.ŌĆÖŌĆÖThis story┬Āput it succinctlyŌĆöNvidiaŌĆÖs Wow factor might be fading. Rate cuts in the US could also be the catalyst for emerging markets. After all, there are strong fundamental reasons for it.Ruchir Joshi, writing in the FT, says, ŌĆśŌĆÖAfter weakening sharply in the past decade, emerging economies are rebuilding their growth lead over developed economies, including even the strongest one, the US, to levels not seen in 15 years. The proportion of emerging economies in which per capita GDP is likely to grow faster than the US is on course to surge from 48 per cent over the past five years to 88 per cent in the next five.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ And with IndiaŌĆÖs strong growth, itŌĆÖs little wonder that the question being asked is:Will a dovish US Fed trigger a sustained bull run? Fund-tracker EPFR said of the week ending August 21, ŌĆśŌĆÖ While fund groups with emerging Asian mandates continue to be the major driver of overall flows, the latest week saw the diversified Global Emerging Markets (GEM) Equity Funds post their biggest inflow since mid-May.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ If foreign portfolio inflows into India turn net positive, it will further add to the huge amount of domestic liquidity already sloshing around in the markets. One example of that liquidity is the Premier Energies IPOŌĆöthis Rs 2830 crore IPO received bids worth more than Rs 1.48 lakh crore. Moneycontrol ProŌĆÖsSachin Pal, writing about the IPO, had recommended, ""Considering the euphoria surrounding recent public listings, investors could look to subscribe into the IPO for listing gains.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ Investors seem to have taken his advice to heart.

US consumer spending increased solidly in July, suggesting the economy remained strong while prices rose moderately. ""Investors are seeing another sign of being in a soft landing,"" said Cameron Dawson, chief investment officer at Newedge Wealth. ""It's another one of those Goldilocks kind of reports really threading a needle right down the center. The market is really getting exactly what it wanted."" A ""just-right"" Goldilocks economy has steady growth, but not too much that it fuels excessive inflation. Amazon.com and Tesla each jumped over 3%. Broadcom rallied nearly 4%, while Marvell Technology surged 9% after the chipmaker forecast quarterly results above estimates. The personal consumption expenditures report came on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week expressed support for an imminent policy adjustment.Economic data next week includes the Labor Department's August jobs report, due on Friday. Money markets suggest traders mostly expect the Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, with odds of a 50 basis point cut dimming further after Friday's data, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Friday ended a tumultuous month on Wall Street after signs of a sudden moderation in the labor market in early August sparked fears of a U.S. recession. The influence of the Japanese yen carry trade worsened the rout. Shares have rebounded since then, with the S&P 500 trading near record highs. Ahead of Monday's U.S. stock market holiday for Labor Day, volume on U.S. exchanges was relatively light, with 11.2 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 11.4 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions. The S&P 500 climbed 1.01% to end at 5,648.40 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.13% to 17,713.62 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.55% to 41,563.08 points. All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, led by consumer discretionary, up 1.9%, followed by a 1.1% gain in industrials. For the month, the S&P 500 rose 2.3%, the Dow added 1.8% and the Nasdaq climbed 0.6%. Nvidia rose 1.5%, rebounding from a 6.4% drop on Thursday after the artificial intelligence-chip bellwether failed to match sky-high investor expectations, despite upbeat results and a broadly in-line forecast. Novavax surged 8.6% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization for an updated version of its COVID shot. Ulta Beauty slid 4% after it trimmed its annual results forecasts, citing slowing demand for higher-priced cosmetics and fragrances at its stores. Intel jumped almost 10% following a report it was exploring options that could include a merger. Dell Technologies, another AI-related stock, advanced 4.3% after lifting its annual revenue and profit forecasts, opens new tab. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, majority owned by former U.S. President Donald Trump, dipped 1.7% to a record low, leaving its stock market value at $3.9 billion. Advancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 6.6-to-one ratio. The S&P 500 posted 79 new highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 84 new highs and 77 new lows.

moneycontrol.com,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/daily-voice-this-fund-manager-explains-why-he-is-bullish-on-consumer-discretionary-domestic-cyclicals-segments-12811125.html,"Daily Voice: This fund manager explains why he is bullish on consumer discretionary, domestic cyclicals segments",Anirudh Garg is the Partner and Fund Manager at Invasset.Related stories.,"""We view consumer discretionary category as a major driver of growth and keep a bullish stance on stocks of consumer discretionary companies,"" Anirudh Garg, Partner and Fund Manager at Invasset, said in an interview toMoneycontrol. ""The growth in incomes, the acceleration of urbanization, and an increase in the middle class, all contribute to the tremendous growth of the discretionary spending on such products like cars, electronic goods, travel, and leisure,"" he said, explaining one of reasons behind bullish stance on discretionary space. With more than 17 years of research experience in the stock market, Anirudh Garg, who leads the Quant team, also remains bullish on the domestic cyclical sectors, including power, capital expenditure (capex), and manufacturing, viewing the recent market trends as part of a broader ""old economy"" resurgence. Do you see the risk of NIM compression for the banking names given the possibility of beginning of interest rate cuts? Despite this, are you bullish on the space? The chance of interest rate cuts can firstly give rise to a case of net interest margin (NIM) compression in the banks, because lower rates may cut the spread between the interest revenue generated from the loans and the interest paid on the deposits. However, the impact is not uniform across all banking names. Those banks having strong CASA (Current Account Savings Account) balances and low-cost structures are the ones who can better endure this compression. Further, the sequences of rate punches are the major causes of triggering the interaction of credit activities and demand for increased credit which counterbalances some of the NIM pressure; thus, the influence on the economy of India could be one of the main causes. With the current quest for India's economic growth and digital financial inclusion in progress, we are still positive about certain banking names with outstanding fundamentals, high-quality asset portfolio, and diversified product offering. These factors, as part of a comprehensive approach that includes the efficient management of costs and the embrace of digital banking technologies, are likely to provide support to their profit and growth, although NIM compression is inevitable. Will Indiaâ€™s share in the global manufacturing space more than double in the next decade? The Indian market is expected to have an important spot in manufacturing on a global scale soon. Many factors are cited as reasons for such an upbeat outlook, such as government campaigns like Make in India, Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, and infrastructure investments. What is more desirable is the fact that India benefits from its demographic dividend: the country has a young and skilled workforce. The change in global supply chains, driven by the complex of geopolitical factors and the drive to reduce the China embracement also aids India's manufacturing quest. However, the difficulties including the infrastructure deficiencies, regulation issues, and the lack of high-tech progress must be resolved. If India effectively overcomes these obstacles, the country's production scale in the global market will greatly increase, thus making it possible for India to become a $ 5-trillion economy as it aspires. Will India maintain 6 percent economic growth in the coming years? India showing 6 percent economic growth in the coming years is a sustainable scenario as the best macroeconomic parameters include both, democratic dividend plus the reforms the government does. The country's growth is built on diverse economic sectors like the increased services, industrial, and economic parts. However, this growth will demand prolonged structural reforms, investments in infrastructure, and policies that stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship. Though there is a high degree of uncertainty concerning global scenarios of geopolitical conflicts, commodity price instability due to potential external interventions, India shows a strong domestic demand, is digitized, as well as is in the process of becoming a global manufacturing center, which gives a sound base for sustainable growth. A realistic goal of 6 percent is feasible with prudent fiscal care and wise policy decisions. Are you overweight on the consumer discretionary space? Due to the consumer space's favourable macroeconomic conditions and transforming customer buying patterns in India with the premiumization trends we are optimistic. The growth in incomes, the acceleration of urbanization, and an increase in the middle class, all contribute to the tremendous growth of discretionary spending on such products like cars, electronic goods, travel, and leisure. Moreover, the digital revolution has driven the e-commerce sector to flourish and it has given all the consumer discretionary companies new challenges thus supporting them. Although the threat of inflation and economic slowdown is there, the narrative of India's consumption is strong, due to its young population and improvement in consumer confidence. Companies that will stand out through the force of branding and novelty, alongside potent and well-organized distribution networks, predictably are going to capitalize the most. Therefore, we view this category as a major driver of growth and keep a bullish stance on stocks of consumer discretionary companies. Are you positive on the domestic cyclicals including power, capex, and manufacturing? We remain positive on the domestic cyclical sectors, including power, capital expenditure (capex), and manufacturing, viewing the recent market trends as part of a broader ""old economy"" resurgence. This resurgence is primarily driven by sectors sensitive to interest rates and focused on capital expenditure, which are pivotal in the current economic environment. While some stocks in the capex sector have experienced price corrections, we see this as a natural phase in market cycles, reflecting a period of consolidation and adjustment. These corrections may extend into a time correction phase, where prices stabilize over a period, preparing for the next growth leg. Despite these short-term fluctuations, the long-term outlook for these sectors remains robust. The government's emphasis on infrastructure development, energy transition, and ""Make in India"" initiatives provide a strong foundation for sustained growth. In the power sector, particularly renewables, substantial investments are expected to drive future expansion. Similarly, increased public and private sector spending on infrastructure, industrial projects, and smart cities indicates a promising capex cycle ahead. Manufacturing is also positioned to benefit from this momentum, supported by favourable government policies and a shift in global supply chains. Therefore, we maintain a bullish stance on domestic cyclicals, anticipating solid growth opportunities in the long term. ",2024-08-31 07:22

A stock's eligibility will now be measured in the number of entities participating in its trading, the duration for which it has been traded during a review period, its turnover volume and notional interest. In a circular issued on August 30, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) informed that a framework similar to that which exists for index derivatives will now be operational for single-stock derivatives as well. The circular detailed a new set of criteria for entry and exit of stocks intoÂ and from the derivatives segment. It included the product-success framework (PSF). Also read:ÂSebi revises criteria for stocks to enter, exit derivatives segment Under the PSF,Â a stock derivative will need to meet a listed set of criteria to continue.

Average daily notional open interest (futures + options notional) of at least Rs500 crores during the review period. If any stock fails to satisfy any of the above mentioned criteria for a continuous period of three months, on a rolling basis, based on the data for previous six months, then no fresh contracts shall be issued on that stock.Â  However, theÂ existing unexpired contracts may be permitted to trade till expiry and new strikes may also be introduced in the existing contracts. Once a stock is excluded from the derivatives segment due to PSF, it shall not be considered for re-inclusion for a period of one year from its last trading day in the derivatives segment. The product-success framework (PSF) review cycle shall be aligned with the review of entry and exit norms based on performance in underlying cash market i.e. all the above criteria for PSF shall be calculated on the 15th of each month, on a rolling basis, considering the data for previous six months.

The regulator has raised the median quarter sigma order size (MQSOS) over the previous six months by three times, the minimum market wide position limit (MWPL) by three times and the minimum average daily delivery value by 3.5x. MQSOSÂ is an indication ofÂ the stock's liquidity; higher the number, harder it is to manipulate its prices. Other aspects, such as surveillance concerns, ongoing investigations and administrative concerns, will also be taken into consideration, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said a circular issued on August 30. Also read:Sebi introduces product success framework for single-stock derivatives In the circular, Sebi stated that that it had laid down the eligibility criteria through a master circular dated October 18. These criteria now stands revised. The circular said, ""Given the need to ensure that only high quality stocks with sufficient market depth are allowed to trade in derivatives segment and considering the growth witnessed in market parameters since the last review conducted in 2018, the eligibility criteria for entry/exit of stocks in derivatives segment has been revised as under."" Earlier, the MQSOS was Rs 25 lakh. This has now been raised to Rs 75 lakh. TheÂ rationale given for this: ""Since average market turnover is now over 3.5 times the figure during the lastreview, MQSOS criteria would need to increase between 3-4 times"". The stock's MWPL, over the period of previous six months, has been raised from Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,500 crore. Rationalisation is that market capitalisation is now 2.8x the last review. The stock's average daily delivery value (ADDV) in the cash segment, over the previous six months on a rolling basis, should be a minimum of Rs 35 crores. It was earlier Rs 10 crore. Rationale is that ADDV has increased by over 3x since the last review. Exit criteria If a stockÂ  in derivatives segment fails to meet any of the above criteria,Â for a continuous period of three months, on a rolling basis, based on the data for previous six months, then it shall exit from derivatives segment. No new contractÂ can thenÂ be issued on stocks that exit the derivatives segment.

From 1965 to the end of 2023, Berkshire Hathaway's stock skyrocketed by 4,384,748 percent, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 31,323 percent gain. If you had invested $100 in Berkshire 60 years ago, it would now be worth $4.38 million. In contrast, the same $100 invested in the S&P 500 would have grown to about $31,323 today. On August 28, two days before the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett's birthday, Berkshire Hathaway shares soared, pushing the company's market value past $1 trillion, making it the first non-tech US-based company to reach this level. This achievement places Berkshire alongside tech giants Apple and Microsoft, both valued at over $3 trillion, and other trillion-dollar companies like Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. Among these companies, Berkshire Hathaway also took the longest to reach the $1 trillion mark, trading over 44 years before crossing the finish line. On the other hand, Meta clocked the record in just nine years since its debut on the bourses.  In his annual letter to investors, right before Berkshire HathawayŌĆÖs annual shareholdersŌĆÖ meeting, Buffett wrote that skyrocketing outperform will not be seen anymore. ŌĆ£We have no possibility of eye-popping performance,ŌĆØ he said. ŌĆ£Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital.

However, the company's stock has climbed 28 percent so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500's 18 percent gain. Berkshire Hathway's Class A shares, which are hovering around $700,000 each, are the most expensive stocks in the world, as the company has never undergone a stock split. This is to keep its focus away from attracting retail investors and speculators. So like everyoneŌĆÖs favorite investment wizard, believe in the power of compounding! ",2024-08-30 19:40

Berkshire Hathaway, originally an ailing textile company, was transformed into an insurance giant under BuffettŌĆÖs leadership, uniquely structuring itself as a tax-efficient investment behemoth. From 1965 to 2023, the company had returned 19.8┬Āpercent compounded annual return versus 10.2 percent for the S&P 500 index (including dividends). In terms of overall gains, it amounted to 4,38,748┬Āpercent for Berkshire versus 31,222┬Āpercent for the benchmark index. At age 94, with an investment track record of 68 yearsŌĆölonger than the lifespans of many legendary fund managersŌĆöBuffett's investing principles remain as relevant as ever. Here are some of his core principles: Never lose money ""The first rule of investing is donŌĆÖt lose money. The second rule is donŌĆÖt forget the first rule. And thatŌĆÖs all there is to it."" This quote by Warren Buffett sums up the core of his investment philosophy. Buffett's strategy is marked by his strong aversion to losses. This manifests in several ways, including the idea of not using too much leverage that can wipe you out if the market turns adverse. In stock selection, the trick is to ensure that you know as much as possible about the company, to the degree of eliminating risk. The second part is to buy it at a price lower than its intrinsic value. Once all sides are covered, the idea is to not get perturbed by Mr. Market, a metaphor coined by his guru Benjamin Graham to describe the stock market's often irrational behavior. Mr. Market represents the market as a moody business partner who offers to buy or sell shares at varying prices, reflecting the emotional extremes of optimism and pessimism. As an investor, it is on you to hold your ground and take what is truly sensible and ignore what is idiotic. Power of compounding Albert Einstein called compounding the eighth wonder of the world, and Buffett demonstrated its power in the world of stock markets. ŌĆ£My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some lucky genes, and compound interest,"" Buffett has famously said. This principle leads to the idea that buying businesses that can deliver higher growth sustainably over long periods make for the best investments, as opposed to getting in and out of stocks that perform over short periods, which only end up enriching brokers and adding to tax liabilities. Buffett bought into several companies that turned out to be compounding machines for very long periods. In 1988, Warren Buffett famously said, ""Our favorite holding period is forever."" The three goods in investing The power of compounding will work only if you choose to invest in a good company with good management and at an attractive price. Buffett has held that ""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."" What this means is that a wonderful company will compound money betterŌĆöafter all, a wonderful price is only a one-time pop, which certainly could be a great cushion, but compounding works magically over longer periods. As for the quality of management, BuffettŌĆÖs quote that ""When a management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact,"" and that ""I try to buy stock in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will,"" underscores the importance of a good business, although Buffett has always maintained a high threshold for management integrity and capital allocation policy, which directly impact shareholder returns. Concept of economic moat Buffett is known for taking the concept of economic moats and making it the ""holy grail"" of investing. This principle involves investing in companies with a sustainable competitive advantage, ensuring their long-term success and resilience against competitors. In his own words, Buffett believes that ŌĆ£a truly great business must have an enduring ŌĆśmoatŌĆÖ that protects excellent returns on invested capital.ŌĆØ The advantage of a moat lies in its ability to shield a business from competitors. Buffett explains that in a capitalist environment, high-return businesses will continually face competitive pressure. Thus, having a strong moatŌĆöwhether through being a low-cost producer or possessing a powerful global brandŌĆöis crucial for sustained success. Also Read |┬ĀBuffett's Birthday Magic: How $100 turns into a whopping 4,384,748% gain Margin of safety Buffett has often referred to the margin of safety as the key factor in the success of stock investing. This investing rule that the investment mogul swears by, inspired by his mentor Ben Graham, involves purchasing stocks at a price well below their estimated fair value. The estimation of intrinsic value of a business itself is a function of oneŌĆÖs deep understanding of the business and the moats the company enjoys. Yet, this built-in cushion helps account for potential errors and market fluctuations. BuffettŌĆÖs philosophy has been to sit out patiently for the ŌĆ£right opportunity.ŌĆØ Circle of competence Another simple rule Buffett swears by is to operate within oneŌĆÖs Circle of Competence. In his 1996 Shareholder Letter, Warren Buffett noted, ŌĆ£An investorŌĆÖs key skill is the ability to accurately assess certain businesses. ItŌĆÖs crucial to focus on ŌĆśselectedŌĆÖ businesses rather than attempting to master every company. You donŌĆÖt need to be an expert on many companiesŌĆöjust those within your circle of competence. The size of this circle is less important than understanding its boundaries. Within this circle lie the skills youŌĆÖve developed over your career or life, while beyond it are areas you understand only partially or not at all.ŌĆØ While Buffett has consistently emphasised the Circle of Competence, he has continuously expanded it, investing in a variety of businesses including technology and all kinds of securities and complex structures. One of the rarest qualities of Buffett and his partner Munger has been to model themselves as learning machines, continuously expanding the circle of competence. Look at stocks like pieces of business Warren Buffett famously said, ""I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor."" This reflects his philosophy that stocks should be viewed as pieces of businesses rather than just trading symbols, emphasizing the importance of understanding and valuing the underlying business behind a stock. Internalizing this idea feeds into the concept of buying strong businesses and sticking to them for a long period, allowing the power of compounding to work. ",2024-08-30 19:27

Registered entities can write to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) asking for its guidance in two aspects: whether an action (such as an open offer) would be recommended if a particular transaction (such as buying or transferring a substantial amount of shares) is completed; secondly, for interpretation of any specific provision of securities law. In a consultation paper issued on August 30, Sebi has proposed that the fee charged per application be raised from Rs 25,000 (plus GST) to Rs 75,000 (plus GST) and the processing fee (if the application is rejected) be raised from Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000. Also read:ÂSebi regulations finally amended to restrict association of registered entities with unregistered advisors The consultation paper has also suggested that few new categories of registered entities also be made eligible to ask for guidance, and has suggested a few measures to speed up the processing of the applications. Other suggestions These new categories proposed to be included are market infrastructure institutions (MIIs) and managers of pooled instruments such as of alternative investment funds, real-estate investment trusts or infrastructure investment trusts. To speed up the process, Sebi has suggested that the applicant responds to the regulator's queries within a particular time frame and that the correspondence between the applicant and the regulator be made through digital medium, instead of sending physical letters. The regulator is required to dispose off the requests in 60 days from its receipt. But, as the consultation paper noted, the officials may need clarifications from the applicantÂ but the applicants may not provide these clarifications in time. Therefore, Sebi has suggested that the applicantÂ be given up to 15 days to respond to the clarifications asked for.Â If the applicant does not respond within this time, then the request may be rejected. Central authority The paper also proposed the setting up of a central node to co-ordinate the applicationsÂ for informal guidance. The consultation paper said, ""Under the IG (informal guidance) Scheme, an applicant has to approach the concerned department of SEBI for seeking informal guidance. In some cases, the applicant may not be aware about the department which is concerned about the particular informal guidance. It added, ""Further, there are multiple operational departments in SEBI which deal with informal guidance applications and there is no nodal office within SEBI which monitors the processing of such applications.""

The Nifty 50 opened higher at 25,250 and hit a new high of 25,268 during a positive trading session. The index rose 84 points to close at 25,236, forming a Doji-like candlestick pattern (not a classical one) on the daily charts, indicating indecision among bulls and bears. For the week, it gained 1.66 percent, continuing its upward journey for the fourth consecutive week. ""The reciprocal retracement of the August decline points to near-term targets of 25,400 and 25,500,"" said Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical Analyst at Angel One. During this week's upmove, the market left behind a couple of bullish gapsâ€”one on Monday around 24,850 and another on Friday near 25,200. The Monday gap is particularly significant as it also appears on the weekly chart, suggesting that any dip toward this level is likely to be bought into. Before that, the previous swing high around 25,080 could act as immediate support. However, Rajesh feels that the next leg of the move may not be as smooth as recent trends. Options data indicates that the Nifty 50 may face resistance at 25,700-25,800 in the coming days, with 25,000 acting as support. According to weekly options data, the maximum Call open interest was seen at the 26,000 strike, followed by the 26,500 and 25,700 strikes, with maximum Call writing at the 26,500 strike, and then the 25,800 and 25,700 strikes. On the Put side, the 25,200 strike holds the maximum open interest, followed by the 25,000 and 24,000 strikes, with maximum writing at the 25,200 strike, and then the 25,000 and 25,300 strikes. ""For trend-following traders, 25,000 would now act as a sacrosanct support zone. As long as the market trades above this level, the bullish texture is likely to continue. However, below 25,000, the uptrend would be vulnerable, and traders may prefer to exit their long positions,"" said Amol Athawale, VP-Technical Research at Kotak Securities. Bank Nifty The Bank Nifty gained strength after several days of consolidation, rising 198 points to 51,351 and sustaining above the downsloping resistance trendline, though it formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts as the closing was lower than the opening level. For the week, the index gained 0.82 percent and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframe. ""The 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) at 51,550 would be the immediate resistance zone. Post-51,500 breakout, it could rally up to 52,000-52,500,"" said Amol. On the other hand, he believes 51,000, or the 10-day SMA, would be the key support zone. ""Below this level, sentiment could change, potentially leading to a slip toward the 20-day SMA, or 50,625-50,500,"" he added. Meanwhile, volatility continued its downtrend and remaining below 14 level, favouring bulls. The India VIX fell by 2.86 percent on Friday to 13.39, down from 13.79 levels, while for the week, it decreased by 1.18 percent. ",2024-08-30 16:51

This stability is attributed to domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) accumulating quality large-cap stocks, while foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have reduced selling and occasionally increased buying. He added that this trend is likely to continue in the near term. A breakout could materialize if banking stocks see significant buying, though ongoing issues with deposits and margin pressure are currently limiting demand, even amid attractive valuations.

Vishal Kampani, Non-Executive Vice Chairman at JM Financials highlighted three key trends reshaping the investing landscape in India. ""Firstly, there's a serious emergence of domestic capital,"" Kampani said, recalling that in the past, IPOs were heavily reliant on foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). ""Now,Â mutual funds, the domestic insurance industry, and retail investors are playing a critical role in driving demand for equity issuance."" This shift, he explained, has made domestic investors the cornerstone of nearly every IPO in India. Kampani alsoÂ highlighted a broad-based growth across various industries, a departure from previous cycles where only select sectors such as technology or financials performed well. ""Now, almost every industry is experiencing growth, which is a reflection of the overall economic health of the country,"" he added. A third major development has been the increased acceptance of promoters selling stake in the companies they own. ""Promoters exiting their holdings is no longer seen as a negative signal,"" Kampani said. Though there have been positives in the market, Kampani also finds some areas of caution. ""The markets are in a roaring bull phase, and while investors have made significant gainsâ€”averaging 30% from IPOs in the last yearâ€”it's crucial to be vigilant. Many investors don't even read the offer documents, which contain essential information about the companies they're investing in,"" he said, adding that investorsÂ need thorough research beyond just the valuationsÂ and research from reports. Vijay Chandok, MD & CEO, ICICI Securities added that India is experiencing strong earnings momentum and macroeconomic stability. ""This solid foundation, coupled with regulatory improvements in transparency and market operations, has bolstered investor confidence."" Chandok also highlighted some risks, particularly from global factors. ""The markets are (currently) priced to near perfection right now,"" highlighting that there may be corrections if external conditions change. Ganeshan Murugaiyan, Managing Director, Head Investment Banking, BNP Paribas also noted that there has been an increasing size of deals in the Indian market, driven by both domestic and international investors. ""In the first eight months of 2024, we've seen a net inflow of $38 billion into the equity markets, surpassing previous years,"" adding that this shift is making the capital market more institutionalised. On valuations in IPOs, Ganesan noted that the momentum has driven valuations to a point where they are stretched, though backed by growth and earnings. There is also a trend of more secondary sales in IPOs, where existing shareholders sell their stakes rather than raising new capital for growth. ""I think the mix between money coming into companies for capex versus being sold as secondary by the shareholderÂ is another trend,"" he added. The panelistsÂ agreedÂ that Indian market is in a strong position. Ganesan said, ""India is definitely in a sweet spot, but investors need to be mindful of the evolving risks and ensure they are making informed decisions."" ",2024-08-30 16:40

We ŌĆśfeelŌĆÖ our way into earning or losing our money..Related stories.","Dear Reader, It is said that Nature measures progress or success through how a species learns and evolves. Learnings are perfected and passed on from generation to generation. In exact sciences too such as physics once a theory is debunked, it never makes it back on the board. All this falls apart when it comes to subjective disciplines such as economics. This is where feelings and sentiment get involved. There is a reason why business and economics are all about cycles: what we as investors learn, we also forget. We ŌĆśfeelŌĆÖ our way into earning or losing our money. But there are reminders around if we only want to pay heed to them. So, what are we forgetting about now and are there any reminders? LetŌĆÖs start from the top. IndiaŌĆÖs economic growth projections for FY25 and beyond have been upgraded by every forecaster in the past few months, including the venerable policymakers at the Reserve Bank of India. The argument is that the countryŌĆÖs potential growth has bounced back from the pandemicŌĆÖs blow. Its fiscal balance sheet is repaired well enough for rating agencies to consider an upgrade -- which Standard & PoorŌĆÖs has done by upgrading the outlook on the rating. But Fitch Ratings isnŌĆÖt going all the way yet. The agency has, of course, acknowledged the economic improvement. But it is holding out on the basis that IndiaŌĆÖs debt-to-GDP ratio is high compared with peers and even its fiscal deficit doesnŌĆÖt quite make the cut. Private capex, on which everything is riding on, is yet to meaningfully take off. It in turn depends on private consumption improvement, something that hasnŌĆÖt shown up at all. Manas ChakravartyŌĆÖs aptly titled piece┬ĀFitch Ratings to India: Close, but no cigar┬Ābrings you FitchŌĆÖs perspective. High growth is not new to India, we have visited high growth every 5-6 years (cycles, remember?). The period of 2004-07 saw high GDP growth, but it also had a high debt-to-GDP ratio. What followed was an economic slowdown and tightening of the fiscal belt. While there is no denying that the government has done a good job on practising fiscal prudence despite a pandemic, the debt-to-GDP ratio of above 83 percent cannot be ignored. Are we going the way we went before? Sure, there is no Latin American debt crisis scare, but it pays to learn from Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. Our equity market party rests on IndiaŌĆÖs growth potential. You only must look at the countless times ŌĆ£strong fundamentalsŌĆØ and ŌĆ£growth potentialŌĆØ were thrown around in every valuation conversation. Is there a lesson here? Notwithstanding the exuberance around IndiaŌĆÖs stock market mainly because of its domestic investors, many have expressed concerns over the steep premium. But would it be wise to grab everything and run? Larissa Fernand explains in┬Āher column┬Āthat investors must evaluate their own game before selling. ŌĆ£The worst thing anyone can do is act impulsively, either by fleeing in a crash or a rally.ŌĆØ That is definitely a lesson worth remembering. It is not just India but markets across the world seem to be on a high despite rising risks. As┬ĀGillian Tett says in FT piece, free to read for Moneycontrol subscribers, the US markets are focusing on a soft landing narrative and ignoring real threats like high debt, political uncertainty, and geopolitical disruptions. Multiple shocks have normalised deviant events in the eyes of investors. This makes learning difficult and it is easy to forget past lessons. Another corner of the market where exuberance is being questioned is Artificial Intelligence. The massive erosion in chipmaker┬ĀNvidiaŌĆÖs market valuation┬Ādespite the firmŌĆÖs revenues growing at breakneck speed shows that the AI trade may finally be wearing off. Hedge fund Elliot Management has already called AI overhyped and there are only a few real uses of AI. Meanwhile at a fintech event here, IndiaŌĆÖs blue-eyed fintech firms are busy pitching the next big idea, riding on the coattails of the success of UPI. Racking up volume has been a cakewalk for fintech, but when it comes to profitability, there is little to offer. Investors are getting tough here and funding isnŌĆÖt easy to come anymore. Even though the Indian fintech industry grew by a staggering 56 percent in 2023, it is rife with business closures, regulatory flak, and valuation erosions. Questions on profitability have arisen. This is perhaps the right time to recall lessons from the dotcom bubble. Finally, there is a cohort that is learning better. Indian borrowers are learning to closely monitor their credit scores and bring in some credit discipline. Our┬ĀChart of the Day┬Ābrings the findings of credit bureau TransUnion Cibil about how small towns and villages are embracing credit discipline as well as more credit.

The recent political unrest in Bangladesh has opened the door for India to potentially reclaim its leadership in the global textile market. However, while the opportunity is large and tempting, the path forward is riddled with challenges that could either propel India to the top or leave it trailing behind. A tale of two textile giants: India vs Bangladesh The global textile industry has been dominated by a few key players, with India and Bangladesh standing tall among them. Indiaâ€™s textile industry is massive, valued at approximately $150 billion, with exports contributing around $40 billion. On the other hand, Bangladesh, though smaller in size, punches above its weight with exports totalling about $45 billion, driven primarily by its ready-made garment (RMG) sector. Indiaâ€™s ready-made garment exports are 1/3rd of Bangladesh at $15 billion and are almost stagnant since 2015. The competition is fierce, and while India has the scale, Bangladesh has carved out a niche with its efficiency and export-oriented approach. Ready-made Garment exports in $billion over the past 10 years Cotton conundrum: The yield problem At the heart of Indiaâ€™s textile industry lies a fundamental problem -- cotton yield. India and China are the worldâ€™s largest cotton producers, each churning out around 6 million tonnes annually. But hereâ€™s where the story takes a twist. China manages this feat using just 3.2 million hectares of land, while India requires more than 13 million hectares for the same output. The maths doesnâ€™t add up in Indiaâ€™s favour. Indiaâ€™s average cotton yield is a meagre 460 kg per hectare, significantly lower than the global average of 780 kg per hectare (again World average is deflated due to very low cotton yield in India). Compare this to Chinaâ€™s Xinjiang region, where yields soar to 2,000 kg per hectare, or Brazilâ€™s 1,800 kg per hectare, and the issue becomes glaring. Poor seed quality, fragmented land bank and outdated technology are dragging down Indiaâ€™s potential, and unless addressed, this could be the Achillesâ€™ heel that undermines Indiaâ€™s textile aspirations. The MSP dilemma: A blessing or a curse? To support its farmers, the Indian government has been increasing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for cotton, with a hike of 9 percent for the 2023-24 season and recent hike of 7.3 percent for 2024-25. While this move is well-intentioned, aiming to offset rising cultivation costs, it brings with it a host of challenges. The increase in MSP may offer short-term relief to farmers, but it also raises questions about sustainability. Higher MSPs make Indian cotton more expensive, especially when international prices are falling. Over the past six months, global cotton prices have dropped by 30 percent, making Indian cotton less competitive in the international market. Add to this the import duties imposed by India to protect domestic farmers, and you have a scenario where raw material costs for textile manufacturers skyrocket. This price discrepancy between domestic and international markets not only impacts profitability but also threatens Indiaâ€™s position in the global textile arena. Spinning a new strategy: Impact on cotton spinning The ripple effect of these challenges is felt most acutely in the cotton spinning industry. When international cotton prices were high, Indian yarn exports flourished. But as global prices plummeted, the tables turned. Now, with domestic cotton prices propped up by MSP and import duties, Indian yarn is struggling to find its footing in the global market. The surplus yarn that canâ€™t be exported is being funnelled into the domestic market, causing an oversupply that drives down prices. For Indian spinning mills, this is a double whammy -- reduced export competitiveness and shrinking margins at home. Without a strategic shift, the future looks uncertain for this critical segment of the textile value chain. The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities Indiaâ€™s journey to becoming the worldâ€™s next textile hub is far from straightforward. The challenges are daunting -- low cotton yield, high domestic prices, availability and higher prices for manmade fibres and fierce global competition. Yet, the opportunities are equally compelling. With the right mix of innovation, government support, and strategic foresight, India can weave its way back to the top. The world is watching, and the stakes are high. Will India rise to the occasion, or will it let this opportunity slip through its fingers? The answer lies in how well it can address its internal challenges and leverage the new seeds of change being sown today. The fabric of Indiaâ€™s future in textiles is being woven as we speak, and only time will tell if itâ€™s a tapestry of success. - Pankaj Tibrewal is Founder & CIO, IKIGAI Asset Manager ",2024-08-30 15:37

The definition of association covers ""referral of a client"",Â which was a big source ofÂ revenue for finfluencers and a significant source of new clientele for big brokers. The amended regulations also restrict the association with entities who makeÂ any claims about returns or performance unlessÂ the entities are permitted to do so by the regulator. The new Â regulations also askÂ registeredÂ entities to ensure that their associated persons are in compliance. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had been given the clearance for this by its Board in their June 27 meeting. The regulator announced the amendment through a gazette notification on August 26 and through a public notice on its website on August 29.

Regulated entities include entities registered with Sebi under Section 12 of the Sebi Act such as stock brokers and merchant bankers, asset management companies, investment managers and managers of real-estate investment trust (REITs). Besides transfer of money, the definition of ""association"" includes referral of a client, interaction of information technology systems, and any other association of a similar nature or character. Two exceptions have been given in the new regulations. One is that registered entities are allowed to associate with unregistered entities if the association is through a platform which is ""specified"" by Sebi and which has mechanisms in place to take preventive and curative actions, to ensure that the platform is not being used for the providing unregistered advisory or giving assurances on performance without permission. The second exception is for associating with people who are engaged only in investor education, provided that such a person/people do not indulge in providing unregistered advisory services or making assurances of performance without permission. On the digital platform AtÂ a conference conducted by FICCI on August 2, Sebi's Whole-Time Member Kamlesh Varshney had said that any of the commonly used digital platforms could soon be notified as the one through which registered entities can associate with unregistered entities. He had said that the market regulator had already seen successÂ by collaborating with a few platforms, who had the ability to detect and take down content that is in violation of the Sebi regulations. ""Some of the digital platforms have said that they have the capability to identify such content... if we say that these platforms have the ability, then you (as a registered entity) won't have a problem associating with such platforms,"" he said.

Analysts, meanwhile, are of the view that IndiGo has a strong hold in the aviation market, which should keep its wings soaring higher. Chokkalingam G, founder of Equinomics Research suggested a strong 'buy' for IndiGo, saying that the market is not much concerned about the promoters' stake sale since it is not the first time Gangwal and his family have offloaded their stake. He expects another seven percent upside from current levels, given that other peers like GoFirst and Jet Airways stand defunct, while SpiceJet has significantly trimmed its fleet network. Moreover, the changing industry dynamics, strong airline growth story, and easing cool prices - all factors bode well for IndiGo's momentum, he added. Similarly, Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities believes that the stock's correction post the block deal was just temporary and current market dynamics stands favorable for IndiGo. â€śAs long as the company is doing well, people are not too concerned whether the promoter's stake is going up or down,"" he says. The Chinkerpoo Family trust, whose trustee is Rakesh Gangwal's wife Sobha Gangwal, along with JPMorgan Trust Company of Delaware held 13.5 percent stake, as per June shareholding data. Post the bulk deal on August 29, the trust holds 8.24 percent stake. It offloaded 2.02 crore shares or 5.25 percent stake at Rs 4,715 apiece.

Amit Goel, co-founder and chief global strategist at Pace 360, shared this optimistic outlook, highlighting L&T's potential to emerge as a major beneficiary. L&T's expertise in executing large-scale projects positions it as a strong candidate for contracts related to these new industrial hubs, he pointed out.

These developments are aimed at driving the government's goal of achieving $2 trillion in exports by 2030. As these smart cities will require significant construction efforts, companies such as Tata Steel, NBCC, and Ultratech Cement are also expected to benefit. Goel noted that UltraTech Cement, as the largest cement producer in India, is well-positioned to capitalise on the increased construction activity associated with the industrial smart cities project. Furthermore, the Cabinet has approved Rs 4,136 crore in equity support for northeastern states to develop hydropower projects with a total capacity of 15,000 MW over the next eight years.

The International Energy Agency projects an additional 3,178 GW between 2024 and 2028. India's capacity is expected to reach 500 GW by 2030, up from 192 GW at the end of FY24, benefiting EPC companies. Anand Rathi forecasts solar EPC orders worth around Rs 49,600 crore across markets. Reliance Industries' plan to develop 100 GW of renewable energy (mainly solar and battery storage) by 2030 could provide EPC opportunities worth Rs. 1.1 trillion from FY26-31, with about Rs 30,000Â crore for Sterling and Wilson, along with O&M services worth Rs 2,400 crore. Anand Rathi noted that Sterling and Wilson's stronger financial position, supported by timely fundraising and a stake sale to Reliance Industries (RIL), positions it well to capitalise on global solar capacity additions (estimated at 2,317 GW from 2024-28 by the IEA). RIL's renewable energy plans present long-term opportunities. It aims to install 100 GW of renewable energy capacity, primarily solar and battery storage, by 2030 to achieve net-zero goals by 2035. This could offer overall EPC opportunities of Rs 1.1 trillion, with Rs 30,000 crore for Sterling & Wilson over FY26-31 (assuming a 50% share), along with Rs 2,400 crore in O&M services.

ThisÂ comes after a 2.5 percent year-on-year decline in passenger vehicle sales for July to 3.41 lakh units, likely driven by moderated demand and inventory adjustments. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services stated that demand trends in August also remained weak in most segments, except for two-wheelers asÂ customers deferred purchases, especially for passenger vehicles, expecting better discounts in September. However, Nomura has a hopeful outlook to offer for automobile players. The firm believes that a pickup in demand during the festive season, which will arrive 11 days earlier in 2024 (Diwali on November 1, 2024, compared to November 12 in 2023), could help normalise inventory levels. ""This shift is expected to result in a much stronger October 2024 and a weaker November 2024 on a year-on-year basis.

Reliance Retail With announcements shared across RILâ€™s sectors, the consumer-centric businesses continue to post double-digit EBITDA growth. According to brokerage Motilal Oswal,Â both RJio and Reliance Retail are likely to record 25% and 19% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26, respectively. â€śThe growth would be driven by footprint additions, new categories in the retail sector, a focused approach to subscriber growth, and tariff hikes in the telecom business,â€ť the brokerage said.

While Jio forms 8 percent of the total global data market, its data prices are a fourth of the global average and a 10th of developed countries. The current 5G adoption at 130 million-plus users will only rise as all smartphones over the price of Rs 8,000 each are 5G compatible, brokerages said.

O2C is Reliance Industriesâ€™ largest profit base currently, contributing towards two-fifths of the EBIDTA and more than half of attributable PAT. RIL will invest Rs 75,000 crore in developing an ecosystem for the new energy economy, leading international brokerage CLSA to note that the conglomerate was prioritizing investments across O2C and New Energy. â€śIn O2C, we see Refining and Petchem segments picking up from the current levels.

He believes the outlook for Indian OMCs (oil marketing companies) is cautiously optimistic in the short to medium term, supported by strong domestic demand for petroleum products and stable refining margins. For the equity markets going ahead, US Federal Reserve's meeting on September 17-18; Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monetary policy meeting on October 4; US Presidential Election result on November 5; assembly election results in India; and corporate earnings data of coming quarters will be key drivers, according to Kunal Jain, who has more than 10 years of experience in investment management and client management. Do you see good opportunity investment in the AMC space? In India, there are three major asset management companies (AMCs) listed on the stock exchanges, namely,HDFC AMC(current P/E at 45.91), Nippon India AMC (P/E at 35.61) andUTI AMC(P/E at 18.12). These companies have strong brand recognition, a wide distribution network, and robust product offerings. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been actively regulating the industry to ensure transparency, protect investors, and maintain market integrity. Investing in the AMC space in India could be a good long-term opportunity, especially if you are bullish on the financial sector's growth. Given the long-term growth prospects of the Indian economy and the increasing adoption of financial products, AMCs could offer solid investment opportunities. Your take on the oil marketing companies? The outlook for Indian OMCs is cautiously optimistic in the short to medium term, supported by strong domestic demand for petroleum products and stable refining margins. In India, there are three major oil marketing Companies (OMCs) listed on the stock exchanges, namely, IOC (current P/E at 8.01), BPCL (P/E at 7.95) and HPCL (P/E at 8.90). Indiaâ€™s demand for petroleum products, especially petrol and diesel, remains strong due to its growing population, increasing vehicle ownership, and economic growth. This supports a stable revenue stream for OMCs. These are heavily impacted by fluctuations in global crude oil prices, as they import a significant portion of their crude requirements. The global and domestic shift towards cleaner energy sources poses a long-term challenge for OMCs. Investments in renewable energy, electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure, and alternative fuels are critical for OMCs to stay relevant. As electric vehicle adoption grows, the demand for traditional fuels may gradually decline. OMCs are investing in refinery upgrades, expansion of retail networks, and diversification into petrochemicals and renewable energy. These investments are crucial for sustaining long-term growth. What is the next key driver for the Indian equity market? US Federal Reserve's meeting on September 17-18, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) monetary policy meeting on October 4, US Presidential Election result on November 5, assembly election results in India and corporate earnings data of coming quarters will be key drivers. Do you see the chance of 50 bps cut in fed funds rate from the US Federal Reserve in the rest of calendar year? The Federal Reserve closely monitors economic indicators such as inflation, employment, and GDP growth. A significant slowdown in economic activity or a notable decline in inflation could make a larger rate cut more plausible. Will the RBI follow the same path? The RBIâ€™s primary focus is on the Indian economy. If the US rate cut influences global economic conditions, it could indirectly affect India. However, the RBI will primarily base its decisions on domestic factors such as inflation, growth, and currency stability. If a Fed rate cut leads to improved global economic conditions or reduced borrowing costs for India, the RBI might consider adjusting rates to support economic growth or stimulate investment. Do you see more than 15 percent return from the largecap banking names? In Last one year, HDFC Bank has just delivered 3.86 percent return while Sensex has delivered 26 percent return. Similarly, Kotak Mahindra Bank (-0.73 percent), Axis Bank (18.7 percent) and ICICI Bank (25.9 percent) in last one year. The trajectory of interest rates set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can significantly impact bank profitability and stock returns. ",2024-08-30 08:41

Further, HPCL share is Morgan Stanleyâ€™s top pick as the company exits an investment cycle; this is followed by BPCL.

Also read |ÂIndia's energy stocks deliver in 2024 as investors seek earnings growth Recent rally in oil stocks Shares of downstream oil refiners, including OMCs, have gained significant investor interest in 2024, benefitting from a range of global cues such as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and expectations of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. The Nifty Energy Index has risen by 31 percent this year. All three PSU OMC stocks have doubled in the last one year -- Indian Oil Corp is up 95 percent; BPCL is up 103 percent; and HPCL is up 142 percent -- outperforming the BSE Sensex, which has risen by 26 percent during the same period. Driving factors for outperformance Morgan Stanley's optimism comes amid recent market trends, as oil and gas stocks have been buoyed by expectations of US interest rate cuts, which could drive higher business activity and fuel demand. Concerns over a broader Middle East conflict, triggered by military clashes between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and potential supply disruptions due to production shutdowns in Libya, have also driven investor interest. Furthermore, Indian energy stocks have attracted global investors due to their attractive dividend yields. Other brokerages bullish too Morgan Stanley's view follows similar bullish sentiments from other brokerages. A month ago, UBS upgraded Indian Oil to a 'buy' rating, increasing its price target to Rs 210. UBS also raised its target for HPCL to Rs 445, and for BPCL to Rs 400. UBS analysts expect the oil market to soften after Q3 2024, which could shift OMCs' profit focus from refining to marketing. ",2024-08-30 08:30

Demand and supply, push and pull, give and take - the simple tenets of the markets. In this tearaway rally weâ€™re seeing, with Nifty 50 scaling fresh highs and the small- and mid-cap indices outperforming the benchmarks, DIIs and non-institutional investors are rushing to buy what FIIs and promoters have offloaded. Letâ€™s look at the numbers. Over the last five years, from December 2019 to June 2024, the average promoter shareholding in Nifty 50 declined by 240 basis points, whileÂ FII shareholding declined by 120 basis points. In contrast, domestic institutional investors significantly increased their shareholding by whopping 460 basis points in Nifty 50. Retail participation also rose, though at a slower pace compared to DIIs. With retail investors pumping the markets with cash, even when FIIs and promoters are paring their stakes, it makes you wonder: what will it take for the markets to finally take a long pause to catch its breath? Every piece of bad news has been discarded: from the failure to cinch 400 seats for the majority party to the absence of big triggers to suggest a revival in lagging parts of consumption and private investments, or reforms like privatisation. Muted corporate results have been cheered while disappointments are taken by the market in its stride. Cries for a correction have ebbed and flowed like the tides, with investors refusing to budge despite high valuations. The fresh higher highs suggest the market is now dancing to the tune of the domestic investors - either large institutions or retail participants like you and me, leaving those waiting for a correction feeling like they missed the memo. As investors continue to seek the exaggerated returns of the past, it turns into a feedback loop: they infuse the markets with cash, the markets outperform, and then more people come into equities, seeking to make a quick buck.

Mahindra and Volkswagen to form 50:50 India joint venture for electric SUVsÂ Mahindra & Mahindra and Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, the Volkswagen Groupâ€™s India unit, are in advanced stages of forming a 50:50 joint venture to share costs, technology and vehicle platforms for future product development, the Economic Times reported. While the scope of the joint venture will include fossil fuel-based models, it will focus on battery powered SUVs for India and international markets. Why itâ€™s important:For Volkswagen, the development is a significant step forward in the worldâ€™s third-largest auto market where it has been a fringe player despite a long presence. It is also a key step by Mahindra, which is readying to get into the electric vehicle space in a big way. #2. Adani Group seeks to derisk debt through increasing public bond issues in IndiaÂ The upcoming public issue of non-convertible debenture by Adani Enterprises, the flagship company of the Adani Group, could be the first of many across the conglomerate as it eyes a diversified borrowing matrix in the coming decade, the Mint reported. The key purpose of the issue is to test and develop a local debt capital market for corporates, the groupâ€™s CFO Jugeshinder Singh said. Why itâ€™s important:This is a rare public bond issue by an Indian conglomerate and the Adani Groupâ€™s first. It is a drop in the ocean though compared to the flagshipâ€™s nearly Rs 57,000 crore in gross borrowings. #3. Private, foreign and small banks doing well in deposit mobilization amid slowdownÂ Although overall deposit mobilization of scheduled commercial banks remains low, private sector banks, foreign banks and small finance banks have been doing well, the Hindu Businessline reported. In 2023-24, private banks, which hold 34 percent share in deposits, grew the base at 20 percent. Foreign banks made large strides in deposits with 18 percent on year growth, and small finance banks clocked 31.3 percent growth in deposits in 2023-24. Why itâ€™s important:The headline number has been dragged down by the weak performance of public sector banks. Private banks are able to grow their deposits better because of their aggressive mobilization and ability to undertake digital customer analytics and transmit the results to front-end operations. #4. India should allow Chinese investments as it provides leverage, Arvind Panagariya saysÂ Chinese investments in India should be allowed, barring those that carry security risks, economist Arvind Panagariya, chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, told the Economic Times in an interview.

Why itâ€™s important:The $250 billion Indian software services industry is facing one of its toughest challenges to grow amid a demand slowdown in key Western markets. They are looking for new revenue streams to buck the trend. Other big IT firms are also readying similar strategies. #6. Indiaâ€™s textile industry to raise prices of several products as new quality norms kick inÂ Prices of baby diapers and sanitary napkins are set to go up, with the textiles ministry rejecting an industry demand for extending a quality control order deadline for these products, the Mint reported. Manufacturers such as Himalaya, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble and Nine, will have to meet standards set by the Bureau of Indian Standard from October. Why itâ€™s important:The new standards include measures to prevent growth of antimicrobial agents and rashes. The rules are voluntary but are best followed in the interest of consumer safety. #7. Quick commerce company Zepto raises $340 million ahead of IPO at $5 billion valuationÂ Quick commerce platform Zepto has raised $340 million in a follow-on financing round at a valuation of $5 billion as it gears up for an IPO, the Business Standard reported.

The capital markets regulator aims to make compliances easier so that focus can stay on doing business, Puri Buch said. Why itâ€™s important:Hindenburg Research has alleged the market regulator was unwilling to act on its January 2023 Adani report because Buch and her husband Dhaval had investments in offshore funds that had links with the Adani Group. Such allegations need to be comprehensively countered. #10. India to develop repairability index for mobiles and electronic goods to tackle e-waste India is planning a repairability index for mobile phones and electronic products to address the growing e-waste problem and encourage manufacturers to produce more easily repairable items, the Economic Times reported. The consumer affairs ministry is spearheading the initiative, which will provide a score on key parameters to inform consumers about the ease with which a product can be repaired.

The Bank Nifty is likely to surpass 51,500 as long as it holds 51,000 as support on a closing basis.

India VIX is hovering near the 13â€“14 zones, and the overall lower base is supporting the bulls to buy at higher levels.

Key Resistance: 25,300, 25,450 Key Support: 25,000, 24,850 Strategy: Buy on declines with support at 24,850 and aim for a target of 25,450. Kunal Kamble, Senior Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio By closing above the 25,100 resistance level, the Nifty 50 indicates strong buyer dominance. With the index now trading above 25,130, there is potential for a move towards the 25,400 level. Support for the index is at 24,800. As long as the market remains above this support level, it is expected to continue trading higher.

Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Chandan Taparia, Head - Equity Derivatives & Technicals, Wealth Management at Motilal Oswal Financial Services The Bank Nifty index opened on a flattish note, but buying interest was seen in the first half of the session as the index headed towards the 51,350 zone. However, it failed to hold at higher levels and drifted lower towards the 51,000 level. It formed a small-bodied candle on the daily chart but remained highly volatile in the last hour of the day. Now, it needs to continue holding above the 51,000 zone for an up move towards 51,500 and then 51,750 levels, with downside support seen at 51,000 and then 50,800 zones. Key Resistance: 51,500, 51,750 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800 Strategy: Buy on declines with support at 50,500 and aim for a target of 51,500. Hardik Matalia, Derivative Analyst at Choice Broking On the downside, the Bank Nifty found support at the 51,000 level, from which it bounced back. On the upside, the index faces resistance around the 51,350â€“51,500 levels. If it sustains above 51,350, we could see a strong upward move towards the 51,500â€“51,800 levels. The overall chart structure appears positive, especially after Thursday's close above 51,150. Traders are advised to maintain a strict stop-loss while trading to manage risk effectively. Key Resistance: 51,350, 51,500 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800 Strategy: Buy on dips near the 51,000 level for a target of 51,350â€“51,500, with a stop-loss at 50,800 on a closing basis. Kunal Kamble, Senior Technical Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio The Bank Nifty is currently trading within a range of 51,400 to 50,800. The index has yet to make a decisive move and has been underperforming relative to other indices. For a significant shift, the index needs to close above 51,400 or below 50,800. Until a decisive breakout occurs, the index is expected to continue trading within this range. Key Resistance: 51,400, 51,750 Key Support: 50,800, 50,500 Strategy: Buy one lot of the 51,400 strike Call and one lot of the 50,800 strike Put. ",2024-08-29 21:19

In an order issued on August 29, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has said that, out of a same of 742 APs, eight APs were found to be using non-permissable words. The other violations included the APs now keeping sufficient records of clients placing the orders executed in their names, APs' terminals being operated by unapproved third parties, APs' terminals being placed in unapproved locations, one AP not operating from a location reported by the brokerage to the exchanges and irregularities in the office management of four APs. Also read:ÂMerchant bankers may soon need to earn a minimum amount from IPO-related activities; Sebi suggests overhaul of regulations The order noted, ""it is the duty and obligation of the Noticee (Jainam) to ensure that all APs registered with it should abide by all applicable laws The non-adherence on the part of the Noticee to the extant Regulations, Circulars, etc. as brought out in the preceding paragraphs, clearly shows that the Noticee has failed to act with skill, care, and diligence in supervising its APs and to ensure that APs are in adherence to the applicable laws. The order also noted that, once it was brought to the brokerage's attention, some corrective measures were taken by Jainam such as cancelling the registration of APs who have not changed their names according to Sebi's directives, reporting the new location from where two APs were operating, ensuring that the notice board of tbe brokerage was displayed at the location of APs and so on. These corrective measures were taken into consideration while deciding the penalty. Two years to correct a board? On one of the violations, on the irregularities in the office management of its APs, which included the AP not displaying a board carrying the details of the brokerage it was aligned to, Jainam submitted that the notice board was missing because it had been sent to the vendor for correcting the name. But Sebi's investigating officials noted that details available on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) showed that the brokerage's name was changed in September 20, 2021, and then on November 9, 2021. The regulator's inspection of the AP's premises was done two years later, on November 7, 2023, and November 8, 2023. That is, two years had passed since the name change and the inspection. Therefore, Sebi's officials found Jainam's claim that the old board was sent to the vendor for modification ""an afterthought"". The order also noted that this rationale was not put forward by the APs themselves when the inspection was being done. Given all this, they did not find that the brokerage's submission in this regard could be accepted. ",2024-08-29 18:38

At the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai, he said that stockbrokers are not scheduled commercial banks and hence do not have the full set of capital and other regulatory safeguards that banks have. This assumes significance the capital market watchdog, on August 28,Â issued a discussion paper proposing anASBA-like mechanism, a mandatory offering by the largest broking firms - Qualified Stock Brokers, in regulatory parlance. The proposals, if implemented, would take away the float money from broking firms as investors will no longer need to park money with the brokerages to trade in stocks. ""From a transparency, efficiency and risk perspective, we would all be better off if the implicit broking revenues from having client load balances were to be eventually replaced fully by explicit and transparent fees in a competitive market,"" said Narayan while speaking at the Global Fintech Fest. The interest income is on account of broking firms placing the client funds in banks, fixed deposits, and other permitted instruments. Even if one factors in an interest rate of six percent annually, the implicit annual income for brokers is over Rs 12,000 crore, explained Narayan. He, however, added that clients should also be prepared for market driven charges and fees. ""For their part, I suggest that investors should also be willing to pay reasonable, market driven and current prices for accessing capital markets in a responsible manner, knowing that there is no such thing as a free lunch,"" he said.

The trust in the system is growing even further"". Vora said that recently SEBI introduced two critical reforms on the depository side, significantly impacting the way transactions and pledging are handled in the securities market, one of themÂ beingÂ SEBI's move towards a paperless system for account opening, transactions, and pledging.Â He noted that this reform has been vital, especially during challenging times such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and said, ""The securities market didn't shut for a second, and I think that is really the testament of the vision of SEBI to move to a completely digitized and paperless form."" Another change was the introduction of the Electronic Delivery Instruction (EDI) system, which allows customers to directly authorise transactions with the depository, reducing the risk of fraud that was previously possible when brokers sent OTPs directly to customers. Vora said, ""Now the customer will have to authorize directly with the depository. This direct customer-to-depository authorisation maintains the efficiency of B2B transactions while adding an extra layer of security."" The second reform was regarding the margin pledge system. Traditionally, he explained, shares moved from the customer's account to the broker's account under a power of attorney, leading to a lack of visibility for the customer. Now, the shares remain in the customer's account, but there is a pledge flag of the depository that comes. â€śThis means the customer cannot resell shares that are pledged or re-pledge them to someone else, but always knows where the shares are going,"" he said.

This options data suggests that 25,300 and 25,500 may be the next target levels for the Nifty 50, while 25,000 may serve as a support level.

Combine that with the strong growth prospects for the variousÂ segments withinÂ the sector and one might end up finding investment options offering lucrative opportunities of strong future returns. However, the sector is highly fragmented, with companies in different sub-sectors driven by distinct growth factors and triggersÂ that make the hunt forÂ good investment opportunities that much harder. To tackle this, InCred PMS's fund manager Aditya Khemka, who has 17 years of experience in the sector and currently manages a Rs 200-crore healthcare fund, suggests three key parameters that investors should consider when sifting for value investment opportunities in this space. Pricing power For Khemka, the freedom to set prices is a crucial metric when evaluating companies in the pharma and healthcare space from an investment perspective. HeÂ highlightsÂ the importance of identifying companies that can set their prices independently, without being pressured by competitors. Khemka illustrates this byÂ comparing non-branded genericsâ€”where companies lack pricing power and are vulnerable to price erosion as competition for a specific drug growsâ€”with branded generics, diagnostics, and API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) for innovators. In the latter areas, companies typically possess strong pricing power, which helps protect their margins. Steady cash flow AnotherÂ sector metric chalked out by Khemka is the sustainability of cash flows. He suggests investors evaluate whether a business will continue to thrive in the future and avoid those likely to face declines. One practical tip for this analysis is to determine whether the company's revenue relies on a product or service that could lose relevance in the near to medium term. If so, these companies are at risk of inconsistent cash flows, making them more vulnerable to earnings declines and sharp stock corrections during tough times. Also read |ÂTop healthcare stocks that keep mutual funds in the pink of health Khemka uses non-branded generics in the US as an example, noting that their earnings growth, often dependent on the exclusivity and market size of certain drugs, may falter once competition intensifies, leading to unstable cash flows. EfficientÂ capital deployment Thirdly, Khemka suggests evaluating the efficiency of capital deployment, such as improvements in return on equity or return on capital. Efficient use of capital indicates a well-managed company, according to him. He believes businessesÂ characterised byÂ shorter timelines from setting up capacity to pushing the product or service into the market are more vulnerable to increased competition in the future, hampering the efficiency of their capital deployment. The real challenge for businesses, Khemka says,Â lies in building a brand: convincing doctors to prescribe it, patients to trust its quality, pharmacists to stock it, and wholesalers to distribute it. ""This process can take a decade to break even, but once you do, the business becomes a long-term success, with growth and profitability continuing to rise,"" he says. The key point Khemka tries to make is that investors being drawn to businesses with the promise of quick earnings growth in the next one or two quarters is a short-term mindset and is common. ""When everyone piles into the same investment with the same expectation, the result is often a rush to sell once the initial gains are realised,"" he warns. ""In investing, patience and long-term perspective are key to achieving greater rewards, similar to how building a brand and market presence takes time but leads to enduring success,"" Khemka adds.

In a consultation paper released on August 28, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has issued proposals to overhaul the Sebi (Merchant Bankers) Regulations. One of the suggestions is to review the legal structures that can be permitted to register as merchant bankers (MBs). Currently, the regulation allows body corporates incorporated outside India to register as an MB. But this poses a challenge in terms of supervision and enforcement, since the entity is incorporated outside India. Also read:ÂMerchant bankers may soon need to earn a minimum amount from IPO-related activities; Sebi suggests overhaul of regulations Hence, the paper suggests that the sub regulation to be modified to register to body corporate incorporated in India with an exception to foreign banks registered with RBI to undertake financial business in India.

The paper said, ""Merchant Bankers are permitted to enter into underwriting arrangements in accordance with applicable SEBI Regulations. Merchant Bankers engaged in lead managing SME issues are required to underwrite at least fifteen percent on own account"". Therefore, the regulator has said that it may not be appropriate to permit OPCs to function as an MB. The other suggestions in the consultation paper include asking an MB to make a minimum amount from public issue related work, restricting permitted activities, increasing networth criteria and including a minimum liquid networth. A merchant banker may be mandated to earn a minimum amount of their revenue, of Rs 5 crore for smaller entities and Rs 25 crore for bigger ones, from public issue related activities.

The market regulator has suggested this, in a consultation paper released on August 28, because the regulator noted that some merchant bankers are only engaged in activities that were outside of the original intent. In the consultation paper, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) stated, ""the purpose of obtaining SEBI Registration by merchant bankers is to engage in issue management and its related activities."" Also read:Â Sebi pulls up Rana Sugars for diverting funds to related parties, asks co to recover Rs 607 crore It added, ""However, it has been observed that some of the merchant bankers are only engaged in activities other than issue management and its related activities. Accordingly, the continuance of such entities as merchant bankers in the securities market is not justified"". This is just one of the various suggestions put forth to overhaul the Sebi (Merchant Bankers) Regulations. The other suggestions include restricting permitted activities including valuation exercises, increasing the capital adequacy requirements for registering as a merchant banker and introduction of a minimum liquid net worth, among other things. Restricting activities The regulator has proposed that activities that require a separate regulatory registration or licence not be permitted under the MB Regulations. These include stock broking, portfolio management services and primary dealership of government securities and activities that do not pertain to the securities market such as syndication of rupee term loans and advisory services for projects. The present regulations permit an entity with a merchant banking registration to engage in stock broking, advisory services for projects, syndication of rupee term loans and so on. Market sources have told Moneycontrol that industry players had asked the regulator to increase the capital adequacy criteria of merchant bankers. Networth requirements In the consultation paper, which has been prepared after discussions with the Association of Investment Bankers (AIBI), the regulator has suggested that capital adequacy be raised by 10x for those who want to handle mainboard issues and by 2x for those who want to engage in the other permitted activities. The consultation paper says that currently, an entity needs to have a minimum net worth of Rs 5 crores to register as an MB. The regulator has proposed that there be two categories of MBs for this parameter. Category I would need a net worth of not less than Rs 50 crores at all times and can undertake any of the permitted activities. Category II would need a net worth of not less than Rs 10 crore at all times, and these MBs can undertake all permitted activities except the mainboard issues. Under the present regulations, MBs are not required to have a minimum liquid net worth. But as the consultation paper noted the various requirements for introducing this: it acts as an entry barrier, it can be easily ascertainable at any point of time, it ensures relatively better quality intermediation and it ensures only serious merchant bankers with adequate resources operate in the market. The paper also noted the various regulatory requirements that place financial responsibility on the MB, such as a lead manager having to underwrite 15 percent of an issue and a market participant having to deposit 75 percent of a claim in case of a dispute.

So my feeling is that we will develop a model which will have Udipi restaurants also and five-star restaurants also,â€ť Shah added, highlighting the need to cover every segment of society through human touch, through human technology, and through technology so that one can ensure that Indians become financially stable. Shah also noted most people are still putting money into assets which are not producing real return. â€śBank deposits, insurance, pension funds, small savings and currency notes. 93% does not give you power to outperform inflation. 7% of investors say you can beat inflation. How can India become wealthy?Â  How do I reach out to this segment of people so that they can invest for better, invest for future and hence there is need to use technology but also within human touch in India every model,â€ť Shah said. On challenges for active funds Shah also spoke about challenges for active fund managers in beating the benchmark. â€ś I don't have a choice but to add value to my customer to keep my job. But do I add value every day or do I add value over a period of time?,â€ť he noted. Shah cited an example of the Hindi movie Amar Akbar Anthony. â€śIn this market there is a stock like Amar bhai, the upright police officer â€“ this is where business is good, fundamentals are good and valuation is good. There is Anthony, who is also good but has taken some shortcuts - stocks where fundamentals are good but valuations are expensive in order to outperform benchmark indices, he said. Shah said that many fund managers have taken a bold call to stick to good business, good valuations over outperforming benchmark indices by investing into good businesses, instead of chasing benchmarks. Â â€śI hope eventually investors will appreciate that,â€ť he said. ",2024-08-29 12:50

Watching Roger Federerâ€™s incredible journey on the court, Iâ€™ve realized that his philosophy and approach to tennis offer profound lessons for investing. When Federer talks about his craft, he delves into the mindset, discipline, and resilience required to succeed. His insights are not just for aspiring tennis players but for anyone looking to master their craftâ€”whether wielding a tennis racket or navigating the stock market. Federerâ€™s recent speech was a treasure trove of wisdom, and as I listened, I couldnâ€™t help but connect his words to the principles of value investing. Effortless is a Myth Federer's matches might seem effortless, but he reminds us, â€śBehind every effortless performance, thereâ€™s a mountain of hard work.â€ť This resonates deeply with value investing. The appearance of easy success in investments usually belies the meticulous analysis and relentless effort behind the scenes. Diving into financial statements and market trends, we work tirelessly to build a foundation of hard work and dedication. Federerâ€™s on-court grace masks his rigorous preparation, just as our investment triumphs stem from diligent effort. Belief in Yourself Must Be Earned Federerâ€™s assertion, â€śBelief in yourself comes from putting in the work,â€ť holds true for value investors. Confidence in our decisions arises from thorough research and understanding. By diligently analysing companies, we build a foundation of self-belief that steadies us during market volatility. This earned confidence anchors us, preventing rash decisions driven by fear or greed. Through consistent effort and preparation, we earn our belief just as Federer has. Winning is Easy When Everything Clicks â€śWhen everything clicks, winning feels easy,â€ť Federer remarked. In value investing, this alignment occurs when a well-researched portfolio meets favourable market conditions. However, reaching this stage requires strategic planning, patience, and adaptability. Ensuring our portfolios are diversified and well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities mirrors Federerâ€™s game readiness. Success, whether on the court or in the market, occurs when preparation meets opportunity. Dealing with Losses Federer spoke candidly about handling losses: â€śLosses teach you more than wins.â€ť This lesson is invaluable for value investors. Losses are inevitable, and our response to them is crucial. Analysing our losses helps us understand what went wrong and refine our strategies. Maintaining a long-term perspective, learning from our mistakes, and continuously improving are essential. Each loss in investing, like each loss on the court, offers a hidden lesson for growth. Itâ€™s Only a Point â€śEach point is just a part of the larger game,â€ť Federer said, urging us to keep perspective. In value investing, each investment is just one piece of our overall strategy. Avoiding overattachment to any single stock and focusing on how each contributes to our broader financial goals is vital. This holistic view prevents emotional decisions based on short-term fluctuations. Viewing each investment as part of our long-term strategy keeps us grounded and focused. Adapting and Growing â€śThe key to staying on top is adapting and growing,â€ť Federer advised. The marketâ€™s dynamic nature demands continuous learning and adaptability. Embracing changes in market conditions and refining our strategies are essential for long-term growth. Just as Federer adapts his techniques to stay competitive, we must evolve our investment approaches to thrive in a changing financial landscape. Adaptation ensures resilience and success in both arenas. Reflecting on Roger Federerâ€™s wisdom, itâ€™s clear that the principles guiding a tennis legend are remarkably aligned with those of successful value investors. Whether itâ€™s stepping out of comfort zones, embracing hard work, or learning from losses, Federerâ€™s insights offer a roadmap for achieving excellence. His journey underscores the dedication, resilience, and continuous improvement required for success. By applying these lessons to our investing strategies, we aim not only for financial success but also strive for a fulfilling and purposeful life. Federerâ€™s approach reminds us that true mastery, in tennis or investing, requires unwavering commitment and a constant drive to improve. ",2024-08-29 10:32

Major deals involved companies like Ambuja Cement, Tata Tech, GMR Airports, Zomato, PNB Housing, and Nykaa, worth about Rs22,000 crore..Related stories.","After leading in selling in Indian markets among Asian peers, foreign investors have shifted to buying, acquiring over $1.6 billion in the last seven sessions. Between August 16-27, FIIs poured more than $1.6 billion into Indian equities, as per NSDL data. During this period, FIIs were sellers in only two sessions -- on 19 August and August 21. During this period, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty rose over 1.4% each, while BSE MidCap and SmallCap gained 1.8% and 2.4%, respectively. Analysts say recent FII buying was driven by large block and bulk deals last week. Major deals involved companies like Ambuja Cement, Tata Tech, GMR Airports, Zomato, PNB Housing, and Nykaa, worth about Rs 22,000 crore. Some believe the buying was sector-specific, indicating no significant shift in FIIs' stance on India. Few suggest following the Jackson Hole meeting, there is speculation that the Fed might cut rates soon, potentially boosting FII confidence. India's strong economic performance and stable macro data have turned it into an attractive market, prompting FIIs to switch from selling to buying in search of liquidity and alpha. However, analysts are divided on whether this trend will continue, with some expecting sustained inflows, while others await further data. According to Dr. Ravi Singh, SVP- Retail Research, Religare Broking, of late, several positive developments have led to renewed buying interest by FIIs. These include improvements in global economic conditions, which have eased inflationary pressures and created a stable outlook for interest rates. Further, strong economic fundamentals in India, along with stable corporate earnings, proved Indian equities an attractive bet. The stabilization of the rupee and positive sentiment about India's growth prospects have further bolstered FII interest in Indian markets. Earlier, between August 1-14, FIIs sold around $2.12 billion, marking the highest outflow among emerging markets. During this period, Sensex and Nifty fell over 1%, and BSE MidCap and SmallCap declined 1% and 1.3%, respectively. In August, FIIs withdrew $1.14 billion from Japan, $1.6 billion from South Korea, $1.17 billion from Taiwan, and smaller amounts from Thailand and Vietnam. Conversely, they invested $1.35 billion in Brazil, $899 million in Indonesia, $278 million in Malaysia, and $121 million in the Philippines. Analysts noted that in early August FIIs continued selling due to uncertainty about a potential Fed rate cut. Global markets experienced significant volatility due to weak US economic data, recession fears, and the Bank of Japan's hawkish stance. Japan's market was particularly impacted by the unwinding of the yen carry trade, causing a 20-yen drop in the dollar-yen pair from July 3 to August 5, following Japan's intervention and a Bank of Japan rate hike. However, markets have since rallied as the Bank of Japan reassured investors and US jobless claims data alleviated slowdown concerns. Souvik Saha, Investment Strategist at DSP Mutual Fund, noted that the recent FII flows into Indian markets are driven by recent stock-specific deals rather than a broad-based sector rally. He mentioned that the Jackson Hole meeting hinted at a possible Fed rate cut, which could benefit emerging markets, with India in a strong position due to consistent domestic economic growth and stable government. Saha expects MSCI India to grow 14-15 percent this year and 15-16 percent next year, supported by stable earnings. While mid and small-cap earnings are volatile, they remain stock-specific. He believes FIIs are shifting focus from finance to new sectors like discretionary, pharma, healthcare and energy, and sees a potential comeback for FIIs into the Indian market. Analysts suggest that going forward, FIIs are expected to adopt a cautious yet opportunistic approach. Continued inflows into India are likely if global conditions remain stable and the countryâ€™s economic outlook stays positive. However, renewed global uncertainties or negative developments could lead to more cautious FII positioning. FIIs are expected to focus primarily on sectors with strong growth potential and companies with solid fundamentals. ",2024-08-29 09:02

Catch all the market action on our LIVE blog Investec analysts, in its recent note, said that Jana SFB's asset reconstruction company (ARC)-led strategy helped keep bad loans under control. Moreover, it used business correspondents to access agricultural loans with safety measures. On liabilities, it added that the lender needs more investments in order to catch up with the top 3 SFBs. However, analysts expect Jana SFB to deliver strong earnings growth over FY24-27 as cost ratios and credit costs improve. ""We forecast 21 percent profit-before-tax (PBT) CAGR over FY24-27 with an average return on equity (RoE) of 17 percent. Jana SFB's valuations stand inexpensive at 1.2x FY26 P/B,"" the brokerage firm highlighted. Jana SFB is the 4th largest SFB in India, launched in 2016 and is serving 12 million customers. It has a national presence across 22 states and 2 union territories, spread across 780 branches.Â From its origin of being a NBFC-MFI, the bank has transformed steadily over the years, leading to 62 percent of its lending book being secured, mostly backed by mortgages. In the recently concluded June quarter, Jana SFB reported 90 percent year-on-year jump in net profit to Rs 171 crore, while net interest income rose 32 percent YoY to Rs 610 crore. The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) stood at 2.62 percent in the June quarter and net NPAs came at 0.99 percent. ",2024-08-29 08:44

Citi noted that the Supreme Court's move could be a material development on the long-pending matter.Â A favourable outcome forVodafone Ideacould significantly reduce the firm's AGR debt burden. The brokerage maintained its share price target of Rs 22 per share, which indicates an upside of around 38 percent. However, Citi added that the current target does not factor in any reduction in the firm's AGR dues. In the case of AGR dues falling, the potential benefit to Vodafone Idea's share price could be around Rs 4-5 per share, or even higher. Ideally, the developments with Vodafone Idea could indirectly benefit Indus Towers too. Since Indus Towers is now a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel, it would have an impact on the telco too, although Citi noted its salience could be far more limited. Also Read|ÂFresh from fund raising, Vodafone Idea pays off dues for June quarter On July 15, the Supreme Court acknowledged Vodafone Idea's submission challenging its 2019 ruling on payments owed to the government. Vodafone Idea's curative petition in the AGR case seeks three main reliefs: correcting arithmetic and clerical errors in the AGR demand; requesting that the penalty be limited to 50 percent of the shortfall; and revising the interest rate on the penalty to 2 percent above the State Bank of India's prime lending rate.

Market regulator warns investors about listing hard sell of small and medium enterprisesÂ The Securities and Exchange Board of India has raised concerns on the rosy picture painted by promoters of small and medium enterprises tapping the market for a public share sale, the Hindu Businessline reported. The recent Rs 12-crore IPO of Resourceful Automobile, a Delhi-based firm with two outlets and eight staff, created a buzz as it received bids worth close to Rs 4,800 crore. Investors should be watchful, exercise caution and not rely on unverified social media posts, tips or rumors, the regulator said. Why itâ€™s important:Public offers of small firms without any track record are getting subscribed many times, driven by retail investors chasing listing gains. Such needless exuberance needs to be restrained. #2. Adani, Vedanta lead in raising money through QIPs, highest in four years so far Fundraising through qualified institutional placements has touched a four-year high in 2024 so far, increasing threefold increase from last year, the Mint reported. Between January to August, 55 companies raised Rs 58,425 crore through QIPs, compared to Rs 17,643 crore in the year-ago period. Vedanta led the way, raising Rs 8,500 crore. Adani Energy was a close second with Rs 8,373 crore. Why itâ€™s important:QIPS are a bull market product, thriving in optimistic markets where firms can issue fresh shares at higher valuations. The buoyant market in India has many more QIPs in the pipeline. #3. Hillhouse Investments emerge as highest bidder for GeBBS Healthcare, offering $870 millionÂ Hillhouse Investment has emerged as the highest bidder to acquire GeBBS Healthcare Solutions, offering about $870 million for the US-based healthcare BPO company majority owned by ChrysCapital, the Economic Times reported. EQT Partners has offered $855-860 million, and a final decision is expected in two weeks as ChrysCapital is doing another round of negotiations. Why itâ€™s important:GeBBS, which offers offshore healthcare administrative services, promises to fetch a fourfold return for ChrysCapital. The global healthcare business process outsourcing market is estimated to rise from $151.9 billion in 2022 to $259.5 billion by 2028 at a compound annual growth rate of 9.7 percent. #4. Godrej Enterprises Group looks to invest Rs 4,000 crore in 14 key business segmentsÂ Godrej Enterprises Group will infuse about Rs 4,000 crore into its businesses as it aims to streamline 14 business verticals besides unlocking value, especially in its real estate holdings, executive director Nyrika Holkar told the Economic Times in an interview after the Godrej group realignment in April. Why itâ€™s important:The Godrej Group was split between two sets of cousins. Godrej Investments Group is run by brothers Adi and Nadir Godrej, and Godrej Enterprises Group now belongs to siblings Jamshyd Godrej and Smitha Crishna-Godrej. Holkar is Smithaâ€™s daughter. Both conglomerates are looking to streamline their businesses after the realignment. #5. Economic growth may have slowed in June quarter because of elections, uneven rainfallÂ Indiaâ€™s economic growth may have slowed to 6.85 percent in fiscal first quarter of 2024-25 from 7.76% in the preceding three months, according to a median estimate from 25 economists polled by Mint. If these projections hold, it will mark the lowest GDP growth in five quarters. The date will be released on August 30. Economists have projected GDP growth in the range of 6-7.3 percent for the quarter. Why itâ€™s important:The slowdown can be attributed to a lack of economic momentum during the general elections, muted government capital spending and an uneven monsoon. #6. Competition watchdog approves merger between Viacom18 and Star India with caveatsÂ The Competition Commission of India has approved the merger between Reliance Industries-promoted Viacom18 and Walt Disney-owned Star India three months after they filed for it, the Economic Times reported. The watchdog has said the approval is subject to compliance with voluntary modifications to the merger scheme. An order detailing these modifications will be released soon. Why itâ€™s important:The nod paving the way for the creation of Indiaâ€™s largest media and entertainment company. The voluntary modifications may set the stage for ongoing oversight to ensure the new entity does not engage in monopolistic practices, particularly in sports broadcasting and content licensing. #7. Defense ministry warns corporate India against using Chinese parts in dronesÂ The defense ministry has warned Indian companies against using Chinese spares and parts to manufacture and sell drones in India, the Hindu Businessline reported. In ministryâ€™s department of defense production has asked industry bodies FICCI, Assocham and CIIâ€™s Society of Indian Defense Manufacturers to sensitise and caution associated makers from procuring items from companies using Chinese spare parts for making drones in India. Why itâ€™s important:India has banned the use of hardware and software for drone systems and subsystems made in China and nations sharing land borders with India. The army has recently put on hold acquisition of 200 logistic drones from Chennai-based Dhaksha Unmanned Systems on such suspicions. #8. Regulatory uncertainty makes renewable energy producers wary of inking power purchase pacts Renewable energy firms and their buyers are hesitant to sign virtual power purchase agreements due to lack of regulatory clarity, the Mint reported. They say these contracts, under which power is sold at a fixed price through an exchange and not a common grid, could run afoul of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules of 1957 that govern derivative contracts. Why itâ€™s important:Indiaâ€™s fast-growing renewable energy sector has ignited a gold rush among conglomerates, private equity funds and startups. But the industry continues to grapple with a regulatory ambiguity which might be limiting the runaway expansion. #9. Adani Ports to build two projects in Madhya Pradesh by investing Rs 3,500 croreÂ Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone will set up a 2-million-ton capacity cement grinding unit in Guna and a propellant production facility at Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh with a total investment of Rs 3,500 crore, the Business Standard reported. Managing director Karan Adani made the announcement at the Gwalior Regional Industry Conclave. Why itâ€™s important:The Adani Group has already made sizeable investment in the central Indian state and the new projects are expected to boost economic activity in the region and generate local employment. #10. Government provides Rs 35,000 crore push to build 12 smart cities and three rail projects The cabinet committee on economic affairs has cleared a slew of infrastructure projects, including 12 new industrial nodes or cities and three rail projects connecting key industrial locations, with a total investment of around Rs 35,000 crore, the Mint reported. The cabinet in past three months has approved infrastructure projects worth over Rs 2 lakh crore. Why itâ€™s important:The latest approvals add to the central governmentâ€™s focus on building manufacturing and strengthening infrastructure to take India closer to its goal of a developed India by 2047. Capital spending by the private sector continues to lag behind though. ",2024-08-29 07:54

Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway hit a $1 trillion market cap, becoming the first non-tech US firm to do so. Yelp sued Google for antitrust violations. Salesforce CFO Amy Weaver will step down. UBS downgraded Chinaâ€™s growth forecast. All this and more on this edition of World Street. AI Anticlimax Shares of Nvidia and other tech giants dropped late Wednesday, with Nvidia falling nearly 7 percent and losing $200 billion in market value. Despite beating Q2 revenue and earnings expectations, Nvidia's forecasted third-quarter margins may miss estimates, disappointing investors who had hoped for stronger growth fueled by AI chip demand. The company's soft outlook overshadowed its $50 billion share buyback announcement. Omaha Oracle Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway hit a $1 trillion market cap, the first non-tech US firm to achieve the feat. Shares of the Omaha-based conglomerate have surged 28 percent in 2024, outpacing the S&P 500â€™s 18 percent gain. The milestone comes just before Buffettâ€™s 94th birthday. Unlike its trillion-dollar peers (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), Berkshire thrives on old-economy staples like BNSF Railway, Geico, and Dairy Queen. Google Gripes Yelp has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant, just weeks after a federal judge labeled Google an illegal monopolist. Yelp claims Google maintains its local search monopoly by prioritizing its own inferior services, harming competition and degrading local search quality Yelp also claims that the way Google directs users toward its own local search vertical from its general search engine results page should be considered illegal tying of separate products to keep rivals from reaching scale. Weaver Waves Salesforce shares jumped after the company posted strong Q2 results that beat estimates and raised its full-year profit outlook. Amy Weaver, the company's chief financial officer, will step down. Weaver will remain at the company as the CFO until a successor is appointed and, after that, will stay on as an advisor. Salesforce will consider internal and external candidates, said Marc Benioff, the companyâ€™s co-founder, chair and CEO. Optimism Overload New Zealand business confidence soared to a 10-year high in August after interest rate cuts, an ANZ Bank survey revealed. About 50.6 percent of respondents expect the economy to improve in the next year, up from 27.1% in July, ANZ said Thursday in Wellington. Business activity sentiment also hit a seven-year high. Growth Glitch UBS Group AG downgraded Chinaâ€™s growth forecast for 2024 and 2025, citing a deeper-than-expected property market slump. The investment bank now projects a 4.6 percent GDP expansion in 2024, down from 4.9, and 4 percent growth in 2025, down from 4.6 percent, as economic momentum remains subdued amid the real estate downturn and tight fiscal policies. X Ultimatum Brazilâ€™s top judge has given Elon Muskâ€™s X 24 hours to appoint a legal representative in the country, threatening to block the platform if it fails to comply. The ultimatum follows Xâ€™s recent decision to close operations in Brazil while continuing to serve its 20 million active users. ",2024-08-29 07:52

Jumping from one sector to another, these thematic funds have aimed at building narratives in an attempt to capture the market's attention. ""We note that narrative-driven valuation re-rating has been the primary driver of returns over the past 12-18 months. However, a few narratives of the past few months such as ŌĆś400+ seats for NDAŌĆÖ, consumption or rural boost in thebudget, and increase in capex allocations, especially in defence, railways, roads, and privatisation of PSUs have failed to materialise,"" wrote Kotak Institutional Equities. As fund houses jump on the bandwagon, there's been a wave of sector-specific NFOs flooding the market, pumping loads of cash into these sectors without much thought for price tags. The result? Valuations flying sky-high into la-la land! What's even more worrying is that keeping this loop going and the returns that come with it might hinge on a never-ending cycle of chasing past returns in thematic funds and new liquidity pouring in. It's like a loop that feeds itself, without a thought of how long it can last. Fertile field for retailers to grow International brokerage Bernstein believes that India's retail sector can unlock demand beyond the top 10 percent of the wealth pyramid and the top 40 cities in the coming time. It argues that the spending power of IndiaŌĆÖs middle class isnŌĆÖt stifled by a lack of desire, but by the need for more affordable and accessible productsŌĆöpointing to a supply-side issue, not a demand one. This presents a golden growth opportunity for companies ready to step in and deliver. The real snag in the plan is the hefty debt most retailers have racked up to acquire a diverse lineup of brands. ItŌĆÖs like a bone stuck in the throat, making growth a bit harder to swallow. L&T Tech (Rs 5,678.50, 3.5%) Recently concluded its analyst day, management launched its ŌĆśGo deeper to ScaleŌĆÖ strategy and highlighted the need for LTTS 3.0. Bull case: Based on the leaders' expectations, LTTS will record a revenue of $2 billion in the medium-term. Following this, the IT player wants each of its segments to record $1 billion in revenue each. Bear case: Brokerages commented that expensive valuations make the firm unattractive as an investment opportunity. Rising competition in the ER&D services space, along with the loss of key customers can adversely impact the topline. Additionally, since the firm heavily depends on technology service exports, exchange rate fluctuations can impact the company. Zydus Lifesciences (Rs 1,138 +2.2%) Shares rose after Jefferies upgraded the stock to 'buy' call. Bull case: Strong US pipeline with at least one launch per year along with improved growth prospects in India will help it deliver higher volumes and margins. Bear case: High reliance on US market can pose a risk to the financials of the company in case of a drop in demand or other unforeseen circumstances. LTIMindtree (Rs 7,215, +5.02%) Stock surged as Kotak Securities upgraded it to 'add' from the previous 'reduce' call. Bull case: LTIMindtreeŌĆÖs strong recovery in revenue growth, driven by BFSI and hi-tech sectors, positions it for significant gains. KotakŌĆÖs upgrade to an ŌĆśAddŌĆÖ rating with a target of Rs 6,200 underscores the stockŌĆÖs potential for consistent EPS growth. Bear case: Rapid technological changes, intense IT services competition, and high client concentration pose significant risks for LTIMindtree. Adverse exchange rate fluctuations could further impact profitability, making it challenging to sustain long-term growth. (With inputs from Veer, Harshita and Zoya) ",2024-08-29 07:16

Brent crude futures were down 1 cent, or 0.01%, at $78.64 a barrel at 0043 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 8 cents, or 0.1%, to $74.60. Both contracts lost over 1% on Wednesday, after data showed that U.S. crude inventories dropped by 846,000 barrels to 425.2 million barrels last week, less than analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a draw of 2.3 million barrels. [EIA/S] Losses were limited, however, by worries over disruption to supplies out of Libya, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). A number of oil fields in Libya have halted production amid a fight for control of the countryâ€™s central bank, with one consulting firm estimating output disruptions of between 900,000 and 1 million barrels per day (bpd) for several weeks. In July, Libya produced about 1.18 million bpd. ""Supply side issues continue to hang over the market. Libyan output has more than halved this week amid a political dispute,"" ANZ Research said in a note. ""Output is at risk of falling further as more fields close"". The expectation that the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates next month also supported oil prices, with Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic saying that with inflation down farther and unemployment up more than anticipated, it may be time for cuts. Lower interest rates decrease the cost of borrowing, and that can boost economic activity and increase demand for oil. ",2024-08-29 06:53

The DIIs have yet again beaten their FII peers in buying Indian Equities. This is fueled by the high SIP inflow which is around Rs 15,000 crore per month. The inflow can be attributed to the massive liquidity that is there in the markets. If we talk about fundamentals, companies have fared well in the first quarter of FY25 and we see the liquidity increasing, if anything else. Coming to the question of FIIs are worried about valuation. We think the market is a little overvalued as indexes reached an all-time high after a constant bull run, but we think that strong earnings growth and prospects backed by order books and capacity expansion make Indian stocks still lucrative. Mainly, the uncertainty around rate cuts in the West which is keeping FIIs on their toes. Where do you see the value (among sectors), although valuations remain high in Indian equities? India Inc just got done with its Quarter 1 results for FY25 and they were a mixed bag. Most of the sectors except a few like Chemicals, saw a rally last year driven by strong economic growth and market expectations but now is the time to see if the growth is sustainable. We feel most of the upsides of any company, be it capex, or be it revenue growth expectations have already been priced in. The recent correction in the Defense Sector has pushed it into a lucrative sector. The telecom sector remains at the top of our list. As a fund house, we do not invest in sectors or themes, we invest in stocks, stocks that have the potential to become stories of tomorrow. Are you bullish on the real estate space, which is important for domestic capital formation? Real Estate runs in cycles. We have seen prices of real estate, especially in Tier 1 cities grow multifold and residential properties becoming unaffordable. If you look at the BSE Realty Index, It has yet not reached 2007 levels of 13,400. We recently interviewed a few infra companies. Everyone thought that the prices had gone up due to high construction costs being one and demand led by consumerism. Easy access to capital is another factor. We all say India is next to China in terms of Infrastructure. But we all know what is happening with China. Right now, growth is fueled by an infrastructure boost but it is not backed by fundamentals, it can lead to oversupply and not enough demand in the future. Do you like the new age & digitisation theme? Yes, we do like the new age and digitisation theme as this showcases the confidence of the companies to go public and raise funds but we still refrain from investing in them due to valuations. The companies simply do not fit our fundamental philosophy. We invest in small and mid-cap stocks that have the potential to become large caps of tomorrow. Are IT stocks at the beginning of a new upward journey? Q1 FY25 results of large IT companies were roughly aligned with the expectations with a few mid-tier companies giving positive commentary. Companies are finally benefitting as they see large deals bagged last year materializing. The Indian IT industry is still highly dependent on the West and it is seen as an outsourcing hub. US Presidential Elections 2024 and rate cuts by the Fed can act as trigger points for the industry. ",2024-08-29 06:34

In a discussion paper issued on August 28, the capital market watchdog proposed providing the so-called UPI block mechanism in the cash segment for individuals and HUF clients of QSBs in a phased manner. The UPI block mechanism refers to a system wherein investors can trade in the secondary markets by blocking funds in their bank account instead of transferring them upfront to their broking firm. The money would be debited from the bank account only when the shares are credited in the demat account of the investor. The mechanism is already available in the secondary markets on an optional basis. Incidentally, it is similar to the ASBA â€“ Application Supported by Blocked Amount â€“ mechanism that applicants use while bidding for shares in an initial public offer (IPO) and which has helped significantly reduce the overall timeline of an IPO process. The regulator is of the view that the system would help safeguard investors from any possible misuse of their funds by the broking firm. â€śThus, the aforesaid process of trading in secondary market through UPI facility by blocking funds, by design, safeguards clientsâ€™ assets from misuse/ brokersâ€™ default and consequent risk to their assets,â€ť stated the Sebi discussion paper. The other advantage from an investor point of view would be that the blocked funds would continue to earn interest in the savings account of the individual. â€śAnalysis shows that clients held an average daily cash balance of approximately Rs 65,276 crore in the cash segment, with their TMs. Assuming an average interest rate of 4% on these cash balances, the total annual interest accrued would amount to roughly Rs. 2,611 crore, for the collaterals held in the cash segment,â€ť stated the Sebi paper. It, however, also added that such a move would lead to broking firms lose float income from such balances and may have to adjust brokerage rates to cover for such loss of implicit income. The overall result would be a more transparent and efficient ecosystem of transaction costs for investors in a competitive landscape, stated the Sebi paper. As per Sebi, the mechanism would also help mitigate instances of misuse of client cash collateral retained by the members and not passed on to the clearing corporation, risk associated with wrongful withdrawal of clientsâ€™ cash collateral by members from clearing corporations and also the risk of non-settlement of pay out by trading members to clients. The beta version of Trading through Block Mechanism for secondary markets was launched on January 1, 2024, for individuals and HUFs, and was made applicable only to the cash segment. SEBI is of the view that â€śthis mechanism may eventually become a popular method for retail investors, such as individuals and HUFs, to trade in the securities markets, provided that TMs are willing to adopt the system.â€ť ",2024-08-28 23:15

The northward journey is expected to continue amid consolidation, with the next target at 25,200-25,250, provided the index sustains above 24,950 as support. Meanwhile, 24,800 is likely to act as a strong support for the index. Bank Nifty is likely to face a hurdle at 51,500 on the higher side, with 50,800 being the immediate support, according to experts. On Wednesday, the Nifty 50 was up 35 points at 25,052 ahead of the August derivative contracts expiry scheduled on August 29, while Bank Nifty dropped 135 points to 51,144. On the NSE, 1,398 shares declined, while 944 shares advanced. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas The upward movement has been aided by sectoral rotation, helping Nifty stay at elevated levels. Nifty has formed a Doji candle, indicating consolidation. The uptrend can continue, and in case of a dip towards 24,920 â€“ 24,850, where the key hourly moving averages are placed, it is likely to act as a crucial support zone. On the upside, 25,200 â€“ 25,250 is the immediate hurdle zone. Key Resistance: 25,200, 25,250 Key Support: 24950, 24,870 Strategy: Buy Nifty with a stop-loss of 24,870 and a target of 25,250. Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital On Wednesday, Nifty reached a new all-time high of 25,129, maintaining its strength at elevated levels. On the weekly charts, the index has formed a bullish candle pattern for the past four weeks, showing a consistent pattern of higher highs and higher lows. On the daily charts, the index has closed positively for ten consecutive trading sessions, indicating strong short-term market optimism. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) momentum indicator, currently above 65, further reinforces this positive momentum. Looking ahead, immediate resistance for Nifty is expected at the 25,400 and 25,700 levels, while strong support is observed at 24,800, with additional support at 24,500. Key Resistance: 25,350, 25,700 Key Support: 24,800, 24,500 Strategy: Buy Nifty at CMP for a target of 25,400 and a stop-loss of 24,800. Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities Nifty has formed a major support area in the zone of 24,900-24,800, and the bias is likely to remain in favour of bulls as long as this support zone holds. On the higher side, the index could continue its journey northward, with the immediate hurdle seen at the 25,200 mark. Key Resistance: 25,100, 25,200 Key Support: 24,950, 24,800 Strategy: Buy on dips near 24,950, with a stop-loss below 24,800, and a target of 25,200. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas Bank Nifty traded within the range of the previous trading session and closed in the red. It has been underperforming due to subdued price action in the key heavyweights of the index. In terms of levels, 50,950 â€“ 50,850 shall act as a crucial support zone, while 51,500 â€“ 51,600 is the immediate hurdle zone. Key Resistance: 51,400, 51,500 Key Support: 50,900, 50,800 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty with a stop-loss of 50,800 and a target of 51,500 - 51,700. Vidnyan S Sawant, Head of Research at GEPL Capital Bank Nifty has been underperforming relative to the benchmark Nifty on the weekly charts, struggling to close above the 51,350 resistance level. On the daily charts, it is forming a rising wedge pattern, signaling a potential contraction in its movement. The RSI is hovering around 50, indicating a lack of strong momentum. For Bank Nifty to potentially move towards its all-time high, it will need to sustain above the 51,350 level. Key Resistance: 51,350, 52,550 Key Support: 50,550, 49,600 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty if it sustains above 51,350 for a target of 52,550, and a stop-loss of 50,800. Shitij Gandhi, Senior Technical Research Analyst at SMC Global Securities Bank Nifty is trading in a rising channel with the formation of a higher low pattern. The index is also sustaining well above its key psychological level of 50,500. As long as this support zone holds, we can expect a potential rally in Bank Nifty in the upcoming sessions. On the higher side, the index has a major hurdle in the zone of 51,400-51,500, above which we could witness a fresh round of short covering that could take the index towards the 52,000 mark. Key Resistance: 51,400, 51,500 Key Support: 50,800, 50,600 Strategy: Buy Bank Nifty on dips near 50,900, with a stop-loss above 50,600, and a target of 51,400. ",2024-08-28 21:22

The move comes a day after Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in Super Micro and alleged ""accounting manipulation"" at the company, whose shares have nearly doubled in value this year on the back of the AI boom. It was not immediately clear if the two were related. Super Micro declined to comment beyond its statement on Wednesday when asked about Hindenburg's allegations. Super Micro said it had not made any updates to its results for the fiscal year and quarter ended June 30 that were announced earlier this month. The company had then posted a decline in quarterly margins due to increasing costs of server production and competitive pricing from rivals including Dell. Super Micro has emerged as one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom as businesses bet on the technology needed to power applications such as ChatGPT, helping its stock more than triple last year. Hindenburg did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the delay. The short seller had on Tuesday pointed to evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, failure to abide by export controls, among other issues. Hindenburg said it had conducted a three-month investigation that included interviews with former senior employees and litigation records. The report made Super Micro the latest target of the short seller that has tussled with billionaire-investor Carl Icahn and India's Gautam Adani. Super Micro was charged by the U.S. securities regulator in 2020 of prematurely recognizing revenue and understating expenses. While the company did not admit or deny the SEC's charges, it had agreed to pay a $17.5 million penalty.  ",2024-08-28 20:08

He was asked if startups are coming to public markets earlier than they ideally should as private funding has dried up? And, if they are compromising on their business models in the process. â€śGrowth, at a cost, will come to any business, but the key is to ensure that your business can exist without capital markets,â€ť said Bhan, adding that when a business is overly dependent on capital for growth, it becomes vulnerable and less attractive to public market investors. He added that many fintech and other new-age companies have demonstrated phenomenal growth, but this often comes at the expense of profitability. â€śThe minute they start looking at profits, the growth rates drop,â€ť he said. Bhan saidÂ there is a big difference in venture capital, private equity money, and public market money. â€śPublic market money has a different set of return expectations and a different set of risk profiles,â€ť he explained, adding that many new-age businesses are now turning to public markets earlier than they ideally should because private equity funding has â€śdried upâ€ť or there is an urgent need for an exit. This early market entry often requires companies to either compromise on their business models or become self-sustaining quickly, he said. From an investor point of view, it is about investing in genuine, sustainable growth or in a business model that prioritises growth at any cost. â€śMany businesses fail because they ramp up growth way ahead of time, and that growth comes at such a high cost that they do not have a sustainable way ahead,â€ť Bhan added. As businesses transition from private to public markets, the focus often shifts to demonstrating not just growth but also a path to profitability. â€śMost businesses that have listed in the last few years have achieved fantastic valuations when they started demonstrating their ability to generate profits,â€ť Bhan said, adding that a companyâ€™s success should be driven by its capabilities, not just by its access to capital. Saurabh Mishra, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Investment Management also highlighted the concern of whether profitability is a given. â€śâ€¦ the debate is not growth versus profitability, it's basically when profitability will come. You want to tap growth ahead in future and probably become profitable at a certain point of time,â€ť he said. â€śPublic markets distinguish between cutting fat and cutting muscle. The cut should not burn the muscle,â€ť added Mishra. ",2024-08-28 19:24

Wall Street witnessed that sway during the equities rout earlier this month and the subsequent rebound, in which the S&P 500 Index recovered $4 trillion in market capitalization between Aug. 5 and Aug. 23 as Nvidiaâ€™s stock price soared more than 28% in just three weeks. Now, with the companyâ€™s earnings scheduled to arrive after the market close Wednesday, traders will be glued to their monitors in preparation for any wild swings.  Going by the options market, Nvidiaâ€™s results are expected to send its shares careening nearly 10% in either direction â€” a move that would shuffle some $300 billion in market cap. And thatâ€™s just its own stock. The chipmaker accounts for 6.7% of the S&P 500, making it the second biggest company in the broad equities benchmark after Apple Inc. It also has a more than 8% weighting in the Nasdaq 100, and it makes up 14% of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. â€śNvidia is obviously the cleanest sort of pure play way for investors to assess the health of the AI infrastructure space,â€ť said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds. â€śSo Nvidiaâ€™s earnings are watched because they have direct read-throughs for so many companies in the AI value chain.â€ť Seeking Revenue GrowthSales growth will be the focus on Nvidiaâ€™s results after earlier reports from AI darlings like Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. showed huge capital outlays producingÂ relatively puny bumps in revenues. For five quarters now, the chipmaker has far outstripped expectations and promised even bigger hauls to come. It has done this by becoming the primary beneficiary of billions in AI spending, so any deviation from that trend would raise questions about the technologyâ€™s promise. That pivotal role has effectively transformed the once obscure semiconductor manufacturer into a key measure of US economic strength. â€śIt shouldnâ€™t be a bellwether for the economy,â€ť said Shana Sissel, founder and president at BanrĂ­on Capital Management. â€śBut it has become one because of the size and the impact of the stock on the overall market.â€ť  Analysts expect Nvidiaâ€™s quarterly revenue to be around $29 billion, more than double what it reported a year ago. And they anticipate another boost in guidance for future sales. But there is one new wrinkle â€” the company has to give an update on its next-generation Blackwell chipÂ amid reportsÂ ofÂ delays and design flaws.Â The company said in early August that production is on track to ramp in the second half of the year. â€śConcerns about the Blackwell chip delay could weigh on the upside to expectations for fiscal 2025, making managementâ€™s comments â€” especially a reassuring 2025 outlook â€” critical,â€ť Bloomberg Intelligence analysts led by Kunjan Sobhani wrote in an Aug. 21 note. Parsing CommentaryAny commentary about Blackwell on the call is going to be dissected like a Federal Reserve announcement, according to Howard Chan, chief executive officer at Kurv Investment Management. â€śEverybodyâ€™s going to be mulling over every single word,â€ť he said. Analysts and investors will also be watching for signs that another Nvidia chip, the H-200, is seeing demand that could offset pushing out revenue from Blackwell. If Nvidia delivers solid results with its current slate of chips, it likely bodes well for the next-generation product. â€śItâ€™s probably a good sign if they put up really good numbers here and those are due to strong demand for H-200,â€ť Gabelliâ€™s Belton said. â€śThat probably paints an encouraging picture for incremental demand for Blackwell into next year.â€ť Of course, Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish on shares of Nvidia. The stock has 66 buy ratings, 8 holds and no sells, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its 12-month price target of around $145 implies a gain of roughly 13% from where they currently trade. Nvidiaâ€™s valuation has also compressed, with the shares trading at a blended forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 38 times, down from 44 times in June and north of 60 times last year. The S&P 500 trades at roughly 21 times its forward earnings. Concerns about how long heavy spending on AI will continue and worries around the Blackwell chip weighed on the shares in the early August trough. But the rally since shows that investors are still willing to buy dips in the stock as Big Techâ€™s AI mania shows few signs of stopping â€” yet. â€śThe bar has been raised, I think, in the last few quarters,â€ť Belton said. â€śIf you think about what happened with all the megacap stocks throughout this earnings cycle, I think the market definitely wants to see a healthy beat and forward quarter guidance above published estimates. I think this recent run up for near-term trading really matters.â€ť ",2024-08-28 19:18

It rises to nine if the IPO closing date of Kay Cee Energy & Infra Ltd is considered ‚Äď it opened on December 28, 2023, and closed on January 2, 2024.

If the top 10 SME IPOs in terms of oversubscription are taken into account, then eight of those were launched in 2024 This assumes significance as the trend is being witnessed at a time when a section of market participants -- along with the regulator -- have expressed concerns related to the creation of artificial demand and unsustainable valuations in the SME segment. Also Read:¬†Grey market premiums skyrocket for upcoming SME IPOs even as experts advise caution ‚ÄúThe stability in the SME market depends on regulatory measures.

He also pointed out that the BSE SME IPO index, which has grown 1.4x this year, may not be justified by fundamentals despite its impressive 66% CAGR over the past decade. However, Deepak Shenoy, Founder of Capital Mind, believes that one should not give too much importance to subscription numbers as the money stays in the applicant‚Äôs bank account and is debited only if the applicant gets an allotment.

SME IPOs of Divine Power Energy, Purv Flexipack, and Indian Emulsifiers also came in the current calendar year and feature among the top 10 in terms of the returns given on the day of listing.  Incidentally, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) announced in July that it has decided to put an overall cap of 90 percent over the issue price for SME IPOs during special pre-open session on the day of debut. Earlier this year, Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had also raised concerns of manipulation and froth in the segment. Also Read:¬†'We see signs of manipulation in the SME segment,' says SEBI chairperson ‚ÄúWe do see signs of manipulation in the SME (small and medium enterprises) segment‚Ä¶ We are able to see certain patterns. However, as per our regulation, the way that we need to construct the entire case, we do need to take some time to do that in a robust manner,‚ÄĚ Buch had said in March. Gupta of Chanakya Opportunities Fund, however, believes that SME exchange has given robust performance and the new investors participating in the capital market have seen the market only go up. Retail investors feel that the potential to make money in the SME market is easier and hence everyone wants to get a share in these companies resulting into oversubscription against the allotment size, says Gupta.

The LIC MF Dividend Yield Fund-Reg(G) has the highest one-year return within the category at 61.11 percent, followed by ICICI Prudential Dividend Yield Equity Fund (G) with a 1-year return of 53.63 percent. As per Moneycontrol data, the average category return for dividend yield funds stood at 48.56 percent for one-year, 24.43 percent for three-year, and 26.11 percent for five-year periods -- outperforming the benchmark average (Nifty 500 and Nifty 50) of 38.03 percent, 19.33 percent, and 22.16 percent, respectively. As per the data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), the cumulative assets under management (AUM) of dividend yield equity funds was pegged at Rs 30,683.98 crore in July, much higher than the July 2023 AUM of Rs 17,368.37 crore. . Incidentally, dividend yield funds have also done well compared to most other categories of funds across different time periods. As per data from Morningstar, as of August 26, 2024, dividend yield funds delivered a cumulative return of 50.99 percent over the past year, outperforming most other categories. Only Contra funds posted a slightly higher cumulative return of 51.02 percent while Value funds registered a return of 49.34 percent. Fund managers, meanwhile, believe that the growth in the PSU space is one of the key drivers for dividend yield funds. Amit Premchandani, Senior Vice President & Fund Manager â€“ Equity, UTI MF, says that a significant portion of high dividend yield companies are in the PSU space, which has seen a sharp revival in the past two to three years. This revival, he adds, is due to an improved profit cycle and undervalued stocks returning to fair value, boosting returns in dividend yield funds, particularly those with high dividend-yielding PSUs. In terms of AUM, the largest fund in the category is from SBI Mutual Fund with assets totalling Rs 9,207 crore, followed by HDFC Mutual Fund at Rs 6,027 crore, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund at Rs 4,642 crore, and UTI Mutual Fund at Rs 4,371 crore. According to Sailesh Jain, Fund Manager, Tata Asset Management, many of the high dividend paying companies have done well and given large dividends, though it does not mean that they have compromised on growth, as many have performed exceptionally well. â€śCompanies which generate significant cash flows are relatively less volatile and have lower capital expenditure requirements. This provides them the ability to generate cash which can be shared with investors,â€ť he said, adding that while many dividend-paying companies are in the PSU sector, there are also private companies that fit this profile -- such asÂ private railway bogie manufacturers or cable and wireless companies. ""The moment government thrust came onto them, everything started moving up. They are still dividend payers and are growing at a phenomenal pace,â€ť Jain said. He added that while high dividend yielding companies are key to their strategy, other factors also guide stock selection, such as management quality, business growth prospects, and financial stability. Similarly, Premchandani believes that companies that pay dividends often have strong cash flows and lower volatility. â€śThese companies typically have lower capital expenditure needs, allowing them to distribute more cash to investors. Sectors like IT and FMCG often include high-quality, high-dividend-paying companies,â€ť he said. In terms of risks, Jain said that the inclusion of smaller companies can lead to fluctuations, though the overall risk profile remains lower due to investments in larger, cash-generating firms. Premchandani added that higher dividend yields provide downside protection in times of market stress. â€śPart of the return comes from dividends or buybacks, which can cushion against market turbulence,â€ť he said.

According to a latest study by Sundaram Alternatives, despite the growing appetite for startups and alternative investments among ultra-rich family offices, nearly 50 percent still allocate as much as 20 percent of their portfolios to mutual funds -- making it the largest allocation across asset classes. Further, only around 10 percent of the family offices surveyed as part of the study â€“ the sample included 30 family offices -- said they invest 59 percent in AIFs and 53 percent said they invest in startups. More importantly, however, the study found that in the next three years, family offices want to increase their allocation to AIFs by five percent and take the allocation to 18 percent of total portfolio. This is the highest increase as compared to Portfolio Management Services (PMS), mutual funds, direct equity, and gold, which will increase by one percent in the next three years. â€śThis aligns with a global trend, where family offices allocate more than 50 percent of their assets to alternatives,â€ť said Vikas Sachdeva, Managing Director, Sundaram Alternatives. Family offices, however, are not going big on startups as their allocation is expected to remain at current levels going ahead. Allocation towards real estate and fixed income is expected to fall by three percent and eight percent respectively. â€śAmong AIFs, family offices are more interested towards Category II AIFs which are inclined towards private debt. Category II is followed by Category III AIFs,â€ť Sachdeva told Moneycontrol. Within AIFs, family offices are expected to increase allocation towards venture debt, venture capital, and long short funds by two percent over the next two years, as per the study.

This line truly resonates with late-stage fund managers amidst today's market conditions. The unprecedented IPO rush is supported by abundant liquidity even at soaring valuations. For PE/VC investors looking to harvest returns, the buoyant mood within the Indian public equity markets have been a great positive and they are looking forward to taking their portfolio companies public enthusiastically. On the other hand, as an investor in late-stage companies, fund managers are finding limited opportunities for value in a market. Private companies on the cusp of an IPO are commanding valuations that mirror those of the public markets, without considerable discounts for illiquidity. Finding Value in Late-stage Investing Typically, a late-stage fund managerâ€™s mandate is to invest into unlisted companies zero to 2-3 years away from an IPO where they have to invest and exit in a tight fund tenure of 5-6 years. To make money at late-stage, the fund looks for companies that have the following tenets 1. Clear IPO-ability of the company --> After heady days of 2021, ""sustained profitability"" is becoming a common question among public market investor 2. Strong earnings growth potential 3. Low ValuationÂ such that there is potential for multiples rerating which adds to your returns. God forbid, if there's multiples derating in the markets, it could significantly diminish your returns even if the company performs well in the first two areas. The third point gains additional significance for late-stage investors at present, particularly when public market multiples are exceedingly high, leaving room for a potential derating when the current exuberance declines. A Frothy Market With High Risk of Multiple Derating A recently released, Kotak Institution Equities (KIE) strategy report detailed persuasive arguments about the market's overvaluation. The Nifty-50 Index's 1-year forward price-to-earnings ratio is nearly 2 standard deviations higher than the historical average. Additionally, the midcap index is trading at a significant premium compared to the Nifty Index. It's worth noting that the companies targeted by late-stage funds are often midcap to smallcap, which are commanding these high multiples as they approach their initial public offerings. Further, at present, the report highlights expectations of modest returns due to high valuations and potential multiples deratings coupled with limited potential for earnings growth. Most of companies under KIE coverage are falling in the potential derating zone including the internet stocks that tend to post lofty earnings growth. Two-track Approach to Valuation The second challenge faced by PE investors pertains to promoters and selling shareholders, often private equity or venture capitalists. These sellers demand a high valuation during pre-IPO rounds, only to yield to the demands for lower valuations by domestic institutions during IPO roadshows. This inevitably results in an immediate decline in returns that takes the late-stage fund a considerable amount of time to recuperate from. Recently, several IPOs have been priced at discounts ranging from 10-25 percent compared to the last funding round. This was observed in multiple sectors like insurance, automotive manufacturing, specialized e-commerce, and financial services infrastructure. FOMO or JOMO? Some fund managers are choosing to invest in growth rather than late-stage companies to steer clear of inflated valuations. This decision involves straying from their fund's mandate, which could be risky for funds with shorter maturities. It demands a different approach, allowing founders more time to test and learn what drives growth. However, for late-stage funds, this strategy could result in needing to extend the fundâ€™s maturityâ€”causing frustration among regulators like SEBI and investorsâ€”and potentially lead to lower returns when adjusted for time. Fund managers are better off today, opting for the 'joy of missing out' (JOMO) than succumbing to the 'fear of missing out' (FOMO) while investing. Facing such a situation in today's exuberant markets, it is better to give back the capital to investors rather than make investments at these elevated valuations.

Notably, these indices have comfortably outpaced Niftyâ€™s year-to-date performance.

IndusInd Bank also rose sharply, ending almost 3 percent higher after CLSA reiterated an 'outperform' rating and noted a potential upside of 28 percent from current levels, setting a target of Rs 1,800.

He believes valuations are reasonable for private banks and consumer demand remains strong with signs of recovery in rural growth. According to him, valuations are reasonable for large caps and certain smallcaps, while midcaps mostly appear to be overvalued. Factors likely to lead to a correction in the equity market are mostly exogenous in nature and domestic macro is favourable, said Rego, a seasoned investor who for over three decades has been making contrarian bets. Edited excerpts from an interview: Do you rule out the possibility of major correction in Indian equity markets given the consistent domestic inflows? While consistent domestic inflows can provide a supportive backdrop for equity markets, Indiaâ€™s valuations are fairly valued across dimensions after pricing in a relatively stable economy, healthier corporate and household balance sheets and conducive environment. Valuations are reasonable for large caps and certain smallcaps, while midcaps mostly appear to be overvalued. We believe factors likely to lead to a correction are mostly exogenous in nature and domestic macro is favourable. Do you think the interest rate will remain on the higher side for a longer period, although the US Fed signals first interest rate cut possibly in September policy meeting? The Federal Reserve last increased interest rates in July 2023 and has kept the Fed Funds Rate at 5.25-5.50 per cent since then, aiming to reduce inflation to its 2 per cent target. Although inflation is still above 2 per cent, there are noticeable signs of substantial relief. For the fourth month in a row, the US consumer price index (CPI) slowed down to 2.9 per cent in July, which is the slowest increase of the inflation rate since March 2021. At the Federal Reserve's annual economic conference, Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is prepared to shift its policy approach. We believe rates will be cut gradually in order to balance between growth & inflation. Do you think the US economy will remain stronger than expected and there won't be any possibility of deep slowdown in the economy? In early August, concerns about a slowdown in economic growth temporarily disrupted the bull market in the US. The downturn occurred despite the US economy gaining momentum in the second quarter. Although inflation is somewhat higher than anticipated, the overall trend shows inflation is moderating. The economy has now navigated through its cyclical peak and is expected to maintain a trajectory of gradual moderation in both growth and inflation, barring any unforeseen significant disruptions. Which are the sectors that can't be missed from the portfolio? Our primary investment focuses are on the building materials segment, consumer discretionary, wealth management, and financial services. The overall earnings growth continued to be driven by banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and auto with healthcare, realty and capital goods contributing. We believe valuations are reasonable for private banks and consumer demand remains strong with signs of recovery in rural growth. Will the valuations remain elevated in the midcap and smallcap space? Valuations in the midcap and smallcap space were primarily driven by macroeconomic stability and growth prospects where strong structural tailwinds for robust earnings growth potential was an opportunity for the SMID (Small-Midcap) segment. While broader market valuations are frothy businesses with fading tailwinds that go through a cool-down in earnings growth will likely witness some bit of correction and quality names within the SMID segments that are able to sustain the future earnings growth is expected to do relatively better.

The index tracks the performance of the largest companies from the BSE 100 that are not a part of BSE SENSEXÂ  and includes sectors like Financial Services, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Commodities, Healthcare, Industries, FMCG,Â IT and Utilities. The weight of the 30 stocks in the index is based on their free-float market capitalization. â€śThirty stocks hold a special place in our hearts.

moneycontrol.com,https://www.moneycontrol.com/technology/does-cognizant-have-the-upper-hand-in-legal-battle-against-infosys-article-12808790.html,Does Cognizant have the upper hand in legal battle against Infosys?,Representative image.Related stories.,"Teaneck-based information technologyÂ firm Cognizantâ€™s subsidiary, Cognizant TriZetto on August 23Â alleged that Infosys has stolenÂ trade secrets related to its healthcare insurance software. The allegation was made in the Texas federal court. Infosys soon rebutted this, saying it wouldvigorously defend the lawsuitin court. Cognizant completed the acquisition of TriZetto in November 2014, forming Cognizant TriZetto Software Group, Inc. Theallegedly stolen softwareÂapplies TriZettoâ€™s proprietary medical claims processing to a proprietary database structure, which reduces the administrative expenses associated with claims processing. Additionally, the complaint documentÂ Â says that TriZettoâ€™s products and services provide solutions to the highly complex medical claims and payments processing problem in healthcare and improve healthcare operations. Moneycontrolhas reviewed a copy of the complaint filed by Cognizant. The complaint states that a similar case was filed earlier against a company named Syntel Sterling Best Shores Mauritius. According to the document, this case went in favour of TriZetto. The outcome of court cases like these depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, however, Cognizant can rely on earlier cases, a subject matter expert said, requesting anonymity. The rivalry between Cognizant and Infosys is well known. Infosys hadsent a letter to Cognizantlate last year lodging its protest against the poaching of its key executives. Ravi Kumar S, an Infosys veteran, who took charge as Cognizant's Chief Executive Officer, in January 2023, hired overÂ 20 executive vice presidents and four senior vice presidents, many of whom were from Wipro and Infosys,Moneycontrolhad then reported. Let's take a look at some of the claims made by Cognizant, in the trade secrets case. Employees stole data Cognizant, in the document, said it made certain Infosys employees sign Non-Disclosures and Access Agreements (NDAA), that â€śnarrowly and strictlyâ€ť defined the details of Infosysâ€™s authorised access to TriZettoâ€™s proprietary information and trade secrets for specified reasons. â€śYet, in contravention of those agreements, Infosys has misappropriated TriZettoâ€™s trade secrets and stolen its confidential information to develop or enhance its own competing software and service offerings for its own financial gain, thus causing severe and irreparable harm to TriZetto,â€ť the document read. The competing software being spoken here is called Helix, a platform-powered and artificial intelligence-first suite offered by Infosys. Moneycontrol has reached out to Cognizant and Infosys for comment on the story, which will be updated as and when they respond. What is Cognizant guarding? TriZetto offers healthcare industry customers a suite of software products as well as consulting, IT, and business process services. These products and services are used by hospitals, physicians, and insurance companies. TriZettoâ€™s healthcare products include its â€śFacetsâ€ť and â€śQNXTTMâ€ť software, among others, to automate claims processing, billing, etc. By maintaining the secrecy of its various offerings, TriZetto ensures competitors would need to make â€śinvestments of time and money to develop a competing versionâ€ť of the said software. What does Cognizant do to protect confidentiality? Cognizantâ€™s TriZetto goes to lengths to protect confidential information from public disclosure. These include requiring TriZetto employees who have access to such information to sign confidentiality agreements, and restricting physical and digital access to only authorised users. These are followed by other standard security layers such as computer and server passwords, security access cards, confidentiality agreements, letters notifying departing employees to return all property belonging to TriZetto, distribution of information on a need-to-know basis, and non-compete and non-solicitation agreements with its high-level employees. When is confidential data disclosed to third parties? TriZetto discloses confidential information to customers or vendors for specific business purposes, such as enabling a vendor to provide services to companies that are mutual clients of TriZetto and the vendor. However, recipients of technical confidential information shouldÂ not be involved in the development, testing, or marketing of competitive software. Who had access to the confidentialÂ information? TriZetto said, relevant to the case, five customers entered into an NDAA with the company who were also clients of Infosys. In connection with the relationship that TriZetto and Infosys had with each of them, TriZetto entered into separate NDAAs which gave certain Infosys employees access to certain TriZetto confidential information. â€śâ€¦Infosys abused its access to TriZetto Confidential Information and Trade Secret Information and exceeded the scope of its permissible access pursuant to the NDAAs, and then engaged in an illicit schemeâ€¦ for improper purposes,â€ť Cognizant said in the complaint. How many times did Infosys-Cognizant sign agreements? In the last decade, the two companies haveÂ signed at least seven NDAAs, TriZettoÂ claimed. TriZettoâ€™s said this confidential information is not readily available from public sources and the company derives economic value from its secrecy. â€śDespite its promises to TriZetto, Infosys necessarily and intentionally exceeded the limits of access permitted in the NDAAs and created its own repository of Test Cases, thus allowing Infosys to obtain economic advantages through the misappropriation,â€ť the document read. A test case is a dedicated set of instructions for executing a particular capability within a software program. How exactlyÂ did Infosys the contract? TriZetto entered into an NDAA with Infosys twice in 2018, and once each in 2020 and 2022. All these contracts had similar confidentiality provisions and restrictions that limit Infosysâ€™ access and use of TriZettoâ€™s confidential information and trade secrets. The company alleged that Infosys created one or more connector tools to extract data from TriZetto software and create a massive repository of test cases, â€śwhich Infosys now deceptively touts as its own.â€ť Cognizant said Infosys has gained an unfair advantage in competing against TriZetto, and such an amount should be determined at trial. The company said the development of a test case requires access to that specific product and also requires a significant amount of time and money, without which Infosys could not have created these test cases. Cognizant said that a jury and Court of Appeal have already confirmed that the test cases are trade secrets. Did Cognizant inform Infosys earlier? Yes, TriZetto said it wrote a letter to Infosys terming the latterâ€™s conduct as misuse and misappropriation. However, â€śInfosys refused to stop its misuse and misappropriation.â€ť Therefore, the threat of continued â€śmisappropriation and misuseâ€ť continues, TriZetto said. Moreover, TriZetto also said it does not know the full scope of Infosysâ€™s misuse and misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets. Has Infosys marketed the products/services? Cognizant said Infosys advertised the â€śInfosys Business Assurance Storeâ€ť as a â€śrepository . . . of 1 million test casesâ€ť that was developed by Infosys Validation Solutions (IVS), which is Infosysâ€™ testing unit. Cognizant said Infosys would not have been able to develop this repository without access to and use of TriZettoâ€™s confidential and trade secret information.Â â€śInfosys is now utilising, offering, selling and distributing to third parties, including TriZettoâ€™s current and potential FacetsÂ® and QNXTTM customers,â€ť Cognizant alleged. The company further said that while Infosys removed the said advertisement from its website, it refused to confirm the pausing of test cases. First notice by Cognizant On May 31, 2024, TriZetto provided Infosys with a written notice of an audit that was previously agreed upon, but had not been conducted because the latter refused to cooperate with TriZetto. In particular, TriZetto sought information from Infosys for emails since November 19, 2018 which relate to TriZetto. In addition, it also asked for a list of all Infosys-affiliated individuals who have had access to Cognizantâ€™s confidential information and the identity of all central locations within Infosys containing the confidential information. â€śThe requested information would have allowed TriZetto to determine who at Infosys had access to TriZetto Confidential Information and whether the access and use of such information by Infosys was consistent with the NDAAs,â€ť the company said. Infosysâ€™ response Responding to the requests, Infosys said it had complied with the NDAAs and ignored TriZettoâ€™s specific questions, and failed to provide any of the requested information. This is despite the fact that Infosys was required to do so under the NDAAs, Cognizant TriZetto said in the document. Cognizantâ€™s subsidiary further said that money damages alone will not fully correct the harm done byÂ Infosysâ€™ misappropriation. Therefore, TriZetto now seeks injunctive relief from Infosys, its agents, employees, and all related persons having such confidential information. Precedents In a similar case involving TriZetto earlier, the company said a federal jury concluded that TriZettoâ€™s test cases are trade secrets despite arguments otherwise from trade secret defendant Syntel Sterling Best Shores Mauritius Ltd. Like Infosys, Syntel was a third-party vendor who was granted limited access to TriZettoâ€™s confidential information. It is said that Syntel gained access to TriZettoâ€™s confidential information the same way that Infosys did - by way of a confidentiality agreement. The evidence at trial showed that Syntel had breached the contract and created its own repository of test cases that were TriZettoâ€™s proprietary software. The jury also found that TriZettoâ€™s test cases were protectable trade secrets and Syntelâ€™s creation of a repository test cases were trade secret misappropriation On appeal, even the Second Circuit affirmed the juryâ€™s finding that TriZettoâ€™s test cases are trade secrets, the company said in the document. A Second Circuit is one of the 13 Courts of Appeal in the US. The matter is in court and it remains to be seen whether the Cognizantâ€™s subsidiary is able to prove its allegations.

This increasing bullishness has led to another wave of buying in IT stocks, pushing the Nifty IT index up by over 2 percent to a new peak of 42,712.50 on August 28. The optimism extends beyond this recent rally, with the sectoral index outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 over the past week. While the Nifty IT index surged nearly 3 percent during this period, the Nifty 50 gained around 1.3 percent. Several analysts also anticipateÂ a rebound in information technology stocks, citing their recent underperformance, which has kept valuations in the sector relatively reasonable compared to the inflated levels seen in much of the market. Alongside that, the positive management commentary by most IT majors post the Q1 results, hinting that the worst for the sector is behind, has ushered further confidence among investors. Axis Securities noted in a report, ""Most IT companies demonstrated improved performance in Q1FY25, suggesting a revision in demand and a stabilization of uncertainties in key global economies.""Â This positive outlook isÂ echoed across the industry, with deal wins and the adoption of emerging technologies such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) and IoT (Internet of Things) fueling the sector's resurgence.

This imminent rate cutÂ could further boost discretionary spending and deal flow for IT companies. SinceÂ Indian IT companies generate the majority of their revenues from outsourcing deals with US companies, improvement in macroeconomic conditions in the world's largest economy can place the sector well into a path for a strong V-shaped recovery, Axis Securities believes. Sectoral gainers IT stocks dominated the list of top five gainers on the Nifty 50, with LTIMindtree leading the pack. The shares of LTIMindtree surged 7 percent afterKotak Institutional Equities upgraded the stockfrom 'reduce' to 'add' and raised its target price to Rs 6,200. This upgrade followed a Karnataka High Court stay on a Rs 378-crore tax order against the company related to alleged non-payment of integrated goods and services tax. KotakÂ also believes that LTIMindtree is on the path to a healthy recovery in revenue growth in the next couple of years from the trough of FY24, aided by a recovery in spending sentiments in the BFS vertical. Other IT stocks like Infosys, Wipro, and TCS also jumped 2.5-4 percent amid improving sentiment for the sector.

Waller said at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai that the US does not currently have enough banks connected to create a full-service fast payments system due to risk management and compliance requirements in order to prevent frauds or money laundering. However,Â he said that linking with the UPI could be a potential solution. ""We don't have enough banks connected to make a full service product. But we have some private banks which can connect to the UPI,"" said Waller. ""We first need to build a compelling value proposition for such an integration,"" he said, adding that this process would still take some time to develop.

""Slowing down the speed at which payments are cleared and settled helps banks prevent money laundering and counter the financing of terrorism, detect fraud, and recover fraudulent or misdirected cross-border payments,"" said Waller. Sorting out the legal, regulatory, governance, and cross-border payment systems will be more challenging than the technology itself, he said, noting that ""linking technology is the easiest part."" Waller praised India's tech-driven payments revolution, which he attributed to a successful public-private partnership that built a digital payments infrastructure, promoting financial inclusion at a low cost. ""I spent 3-4 hours yesterday at the NPCI (National Payments Corporation of Indiaâ€”the founder and manager of UPI), learned a lot about UPI and how it is done,"" he said at the event. The UPI, developed by NPCI, is a real-time payment system that allows instant money transfers between bank accounts via mobile devices. Since its launch in 2016, UPI has grown rapidly, integrating over 300 banks and facilitating a seamless, low-cost digital payment experience. As of 2024, it processes over 10 billion transactions each month, with a total monthly transaction value exceeding Rs 15 trillion.

Looking forward, Waller suggested that the interplay between the public and private sectors could be crucial in advancing cross-border payments. ""Interlinking arrangements would allow banks in different countries, who are users of domestic fast payment systems, to send payments to each other through technical connections between their respective domestic payment systems,"" he noted. He also pointed out that the G20's roadmap aims to address challenges in cross-border payments and enhance global payment systems beyond local capabilities, acknowledging that while technical connections are feasible, the real challenge lies in addressing legal, compliance, and operational considerations.

Resourceful Automobile, an SME that operates just two Yamaha showrooms in New Delhi under the brand name Sawhney Automobiles and employs around eight people, is out to raise Rs 12 crore. What caught everyone's attention is the oversubscription of 400x! The IPO price is Rs 117 per share and rumours have it that the grey market premium is 72 percent. Comments on social media called the investor interest in the IPO ""crazy"", ""insane"" and so on, and have said that the IPO is a sign that SME segment is overheated. Shenoy has taken a different view. According to his post on X platform (formerly Twitter), the outrage over the oversubscription is nonsensical, the general understanding of how much investor money has gone to the company is flawed, and people are missing the whole point about an SME exchange, and the bigger point of investors' right to choose and investors' responsibility. That said, he has written that he is going to miss out on this IPO and that he has no problems with that because there will be other opportunities. Shenoy wrote that oversubscription should not be a cause for concern: ""Firstly the oversubscription is BS - your money stays in your bank account and you simply cannot get an entry easily, so you keep money in your account and bid - if you don't get allocation, it will just get released and you still earn the interest. So oversubscription nowadays doesn't make sense to look at."" He said that smaller IPOs are getting oversubscribed because investors have been cut off from a big source of funding for the bigger IPOs. He wrote, ""Even earlier people would borrow like crazy, 100-200 cr. for four days, to fund an ASBA application, from NBFCs. RBI and SEBI put an end to that, so now the smaller IPOs are getting oversubscribed."" NetizensÂ have expressed shock that a company that was looking to raise so little was given Rs 2,700 crore, which these people calculated based on the oversubscription numbers. Also read:ÂResourceful Auto SME IPO: Investors mystified over bumper subscription for firm with '2 Yamaha showrooms, 8 employees' Shenoy has disabused people of that notion. He wrote that no one has given this company Rs 2,700 crore. He pointed out that money has not left the investors'/applicants' bank accounts. In fact, according to Shenoy, if Resourceful tried to raise Rs 2,700 crore, the company would get nothing because the IPO's appeal is its ""tiny"" size. Then he took on the concern that the IPO may be a sign that people are investing in ""crappy"" companies. To this, he cited the example of Jet Airways, which ""traded for many years after it was dead"". Rationality is a myth He shot down the idea that there was ever rationality that moved the market. He wrote, "" Have put notes here on twitter, in times that were less heady, that a company is GOING TO WIPE OUT ALL ITS EQUITY and your money is going to become ZERO, and people have still bought enough for upper circuits. So don't even start with ""rationality"" and all that. People will buy anything, at any time, if there is a suitable narrative."" Shenoy said that he does not know if this company is ""crappy"" because he hasn't analysed it. On worries that the company is expensive, given that it is asking for a valuation of Rs 31 crore when its revenue was just Rs 1.5 crore last year, Shenoy wrote that he has seen more ""expensive"" IPOs than that. He pointed out the merit in small companies raising small money transparently through the listed markets. He asked if it wasn't a better option that the company raising debt and raising money from private investors whose only focus seems to artificial intelligence (AI) now. He wrote, ""The bigger point is - no one is forcing you to buy into this or any IPO. You can take it as a sign of euphoria in the markets, if you like. But it's just wrong to try and block such companies from doing IPOs - if anything encourage more. ""Yes, it could go bust or the business may fail. You don't get a free ride on return, boss.

Analysts warn of potential overvaluation in some sectors, yet the broader market still seems to have room to grow. Notably, these indices have comfortably outpaced Niftyâ€™s year-to-date performance. Sectoral Trend The IT index rose a massive 2 percent backed by gains in LTIMindtree, Infosys, TCS, and Wipro. LTIMindtree was the top gainer on the Nifty afterÂ domestic brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded the stock to an 'add' rating and raised the target price to Rs 6,200. The Healthcare index was in second position, gaining almost 1 percent. The Nifty Pharma, Energy and Auto were the other gainers. Nifty FMCG and Realty were the top losers after both fell 0.4 percent. Consumer majors such as Varun Beverages, ITC, and HUL spoiled the party. India VIX, an index to gauge market anxiety, rose slightly above 1 percent to hover close to 14 levels. Fundamental View V K Vijaykumar of Geojit Financial Services said that theÂ market has entered a consolidation phase with low volatility, a trend expected to continue in the near term. Falling U.S. bond yields have curtailed FII selling, with foreign investors even becoming marginal buyers. Historically, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) tend to sell when FIIs buy, which could keep the market range-bound with a slight upward bias. This is considered a healthy trend given the marketâ€™s elevated valuations. Technical View Vaishali Parekh of Prabhudas Lilladher anticipates that the index could target 25,600 next, with key stocks like L&T, Infosys, ICICI Bank, and Maruti supporting this upward move. Sensex is now targeting its all-time high of 82,130, with a strong bias. As sentiment improves, the index is advancing with crucial support at the 20 DMA level of 80,350. A decisive break above 82,130 could push the index towards 83,000 in the near term. Daily support is at 81,300 and 24,900, while resistance is at 82,300 and 25,200.

Management stability and Margin outlook Recent senior management attrition has slowed, although high demand for talent means departures could continue. Maintaining a stable leadership team is crucial for achieving revenue synergies from the merger, though the current team remains strong, highlighted Kotak. The brokerage forecast limited EBIT margin expansion in FY25 due to upfront costs from large deals and investments, with EBIT margins expected at 15.4 percent in FY25 and 16 percent in FY26. Despite anticipated revenue growth mitigating margin pressures, the scope for margin improvement is considered limited, with the companyâ€™s deferred wage hikes also impacting margins.

Chairman Mukesh Ambani will address 3.5 million shareholders at the meeting at 2 pm on Thursday. JM Financial pointed out that shareholders will closely monitor timelines for potential public listings ofRelianceâ€™s digital and retail units and updates on the progress of new energy projects. Here are five key things that investors will be looking out for this year: 1. Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio IPOs Investors will keenly watch for any concrete plans or dates for initial public offerings of Reliance Jio or Reliance Retail. During the 2019 AGM, the management announced plans to list both businesses within five years. Since then, investors have been anticipating a timeline for the announcement of these listings. Jefferies analysts predict Jio could go public in 2025 with an estimated valuation of around $112 billion. 2. Strategic Stake Sale in O2C Business Investors will also watch for any potential strategic stake sales in Relianceâ€™s oil-to-chemicals (O2C) segment, said JM Financial Services in a report. Details on possible buyers, transaction value, and strategic benefits of such a sale will be closely monitored.

Progress on New Energy Projects There will be significant interest in updates regarding ongoing projects in the new energy sector. Investors will look for specific timelines for project commissioning and assessments of potential earnings from these ventures. For FY24, RIL has allocated $1 billion in capital expenditures for its solar manufacturing business. The AGM is expected to provide more detailed insights into these developments. Reliance is building a large green energy complex in Jamnagar, featuring giga factories for solar PV, energy storage, electrolysers, fuel cells, and power electronics. However, progress appears slow, according to analysts. Compared to the initial $10 billion investment plan for the first three years, only $2 billion has been invested. 4. 5G Monetization Plans The AGM is expected to provide insights into Reliance Jioâ€™s strategies for monetising its 5G network. This includes plans for leveraging 5G technology to drive revenue growth, potential partnerships, and how the rollout might impact overall financial performance. Reliance Jioâ€™s 5G rollout is accelerating, and analysts expect updates on subscriber growth, revenue strategies, and international expansion plans in the AGM to boost RIL stockâ€™s attractiveness. Also Read |ÂRIL Q1 Results Highlights: Revenue up 11.5% YoY; Jio sees record PAT at Rs 5,698 crore 5. Succession Plan Further details on Reliance Industriesâ€™ succession plans are of interest. Investors will look for updates on leadership transitions, key appointments, and how the succession strategy aligns with the companyâ€™s long-term vision. Chairman Mukesh Ambani revealed a succession blueprint in 2022, with Isha Ambani leading retail, Akash leading Jio, and Anant overseeing the energy business. At last yearâ€™s AGM, Mukesh Ambani announced that he would retain the position of the companyâ€™s chairman and managing director for the next five years. This year, investors will be keeping a close eye on further updates around the leadership transition. Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

Ltd, backed byNuvama Wealth, allows research analysts (RAs) and investment advisors (IAs) to display the accuracy of their trading calls and the performance of their model portfolios, a practice legal experts claim violates the advertising code. Bengaluru-based¬†Pickright¬†allows users to either pick a portfolio based on the returns generated or sign up for trading calls fromSebi-registered experts based on the ‚Äúaccuracy‚ÄĚ of the calls. Users can then place their orders on the platform, which are then executed through leading brokerages. According to legal experts, by displaying past performance and ‚Äúaccuracy‚ÄĚ levels, the platform is enabling a violation of the Advertisement Code for RAs and IAs issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in April 2023. The RAs, IAs and the platform could invite regulatory action for such marketing content, according to lawyers and industry experts that Moneycontrol spoke to. Also read:¬†Nithin Kamath warns of explosion of fake apps that mimic broker interfaces, promise easy trading profits ‚ÄúIt is a violation of Sebi rules for RIA and RA to advertise their services using past performance metrics. A Research Analyst doing this is in violation of Sebi's Advertising Code and any Registered Investment Advisor doing this doing is both illegal and immoral. RIAs cannot have a product that is meant for use by multiple people because their role is to make customised solutions for individuals based on their investing goals and capacity to take risk,‚ÄĚ said Naveen Fernandes, the Public Interest Director on BSE Administration and Supervision Ltd. (BASL). BASL has been notified by Sebi as the supervisory body of RAs and RIAs by Sebi. ‚ÄúThe Advertisement Code for RA/IAs prohibits them from making reference to past performances,‚ÄĚ said Smrithi Nair, Partner at Juris Corp Advocates & Solicitors, an advisor to market infrastructure institutions such as stock exchanges. Pickright‚Äôs disclosure page also inaccurately listed its registration status as a registered investment advisor (INA200015635), although it surrendered its certificate of registration in February last year. Advertising rules The advertising code for RAs and IAs states: ‚ÄúThe advertisement shall not imply any assured returns or minimum returns or target return or percentage accuracy or service provision till achievement of target returns or any other nomenclature that gives the impression to the client that the investment advice/recommendation of the research report is risk-free and/or not susceptible to market risks and/or that it can generate returns with any level of assurance.‚ÄĚ Yet,¬†Pickright‚Äôs Trading Advisory page allows RAs and IAs to display the accuracy levels of their trading calls.  Then there are others...  Most of these appear to have been taken down since Moneycontrol wrote to¬†Pickright¬†for their responses. The platform‚Äôs Investpack feature allows the registered entities to show the returns they have generated over varied periods. Investpack, according to the website, is a ‚Äúready-to-invest portfolio‚ÄĚ with selected stocks, ETFs or mutual funds ‚Äúcombined to beat market volatility with zero tension‚ÄĚ. Kinjal Champaneria, Partner at Solomon & Co, cited the advertisement code issued by BSE Administration & Supervision Ltd. Under it, he said, ‚Äúreference to the past performance of the investment advisor or recommending/promoting any specific investment by way of reference to past performance or research material is not permitted‚ÄĚ. Platform‚Äôs response Pickright denied that it shows the performance track record of individual RAs. According to its response, the company displays the performance of strategies of the registered entities and not of the registered entities. That is, the performance shown is of the product and not of the maker/designer; the regulations only restrict the performance of the maker/designer. In an email response to Moneycontrol‚Äôs queries, it stated: ‚ÄúThe performance track record of Individual RA‚Äôs is not shown in¬†Pickright. The CAGR of the strategy is only shown to logged-in state users for a few strategies. The CAGR is shown for specific strategies from inception on the¬†Pickright¬†platform. This is not back-tested data.‚ÄĚ Nuvama, which holds a strategic stake in the platform, also put forward a similar response to Moneycontrol‚Äôs email: ‚ÄúRA performance metrics are not showcased. However, CAGR of invest pack/strategies based on actual historical data is accessible to logged-in users.‚ÄĚ Nair said that this argument might not sway the regulator since the RA/IA essentially provides stock recommendations or investment advice, and the performance of these recommendations or advice cannot be seen as distinct from the performance of the registered entities. Similar product? Pickright¬†doesn‚Äôt seem to be the only platform sailing close to the wind. As 5Paisa‚Äôs spokesperson pointed out, when asked about integrating the brokerage platform with¬†Pickright,¬†Pickright‚Äôs ‚Äúproduct offering is similar to Smallcase‚ÄĚ. Nithin Kamath-backed Smallcase‚Äôs spokesperson¬†said that their platform does not highlight performance metrics of RAs and IAs and that these are shared only when the clients ask for them. The spokesperson said, ‚ÄúIn accordance with the Advertisement Code, Smallcase doesn‚Äôt use or highlight past performance of SEBI registered RA and IAs in any advertisements or display this information in the public domain. The performance, when requested by the clients, is shown based on the inputs and recommendations provided by the RA/IA and is based on a transparent return calculation methodology shared on the website.‚ÄĚ On Smallcase, returns generated by portfolios are shown after a user logs in and is shown a disclosure: ‚ÄúBy proceeding, you understand that investments are subjected to market risks and agree that returns shown on the platform were not used as an advertisement or promotion to influence your investment decisions‚ÄĚ. Pickright, too, has users agreeing to disclaimers before being shown the returns data. As Nuvama said, ‚Äúadequate disclaimers are shared on the website for information of the investors as per SEBI Guidelines.‚ÄĚ¬†Pickright¬†said that returns are ‚Äúonly shown after user consent for RIA packs.‚ÄĚ That is, only after a user ticks a box agreeing to a disclaimer is the user shown the performance of the portfolio, even against a benchmark index‚Äôs performance. But Champaneria said that adding these disclaimers will not protect the registered entities. He said, ‚ÄúThe addition of disclaimers is mainly to alert or caution the investor of the risks involved in such investment and therefore adding a disclaimer will not protect the registered entities from regulatory action.‚ÄĚ BASL‚Äôs Fernandes said that, if any platform is enabling RAs and RIAs to do this, that is to promote their services or products using past-performance metrics, they will also guilty of breaking the law as accessories. He added, ‚ÄúSmallcase too is in violation of the SEBI guidelines for allowing RAs to use past-performance to advertise their products or services. The regulator should act against such platforms but these platforms seem to be operating under the regulator's radar where possible.‚ÄĚ Brokerages‚Äô take Pickright, which is not a Sebi-registered entity, has claimed that it has leading brokerages as ‚Äúpartners‚ÄĚ. Aditya Birla Money said it is ‚Äúenabling its customers avail services of Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) empanelled on¬†Pickright‚Äôs platform‚ÄĚ. 5Paisa Capital said, ‚Äúthere exists an order placement-related integration with them such that the client may be allowed to punch orders from their platform, which would be routed through our platform after 2F authentication‚ÄĚ. The brokerage added that there are ‚Äúno commercials involved in this association and our integration is only to facilitate order placement through open APIs‚ÄĚ. Zerodha said it isn‚Äôt a partner to the platform and that, after Moneycontrol raised the query based on¬†Pickright‚Äôs claims, it reached out to the platform and asked them to take down such claims. Bajaj Finserv has not responded to Moneycontrol's email. The article will be updated once they do. How will the regulator view these integrations? Champaneria said that after the regulator‚Äôs meeting with its Board on June 27, it is clear that Sebi intends to restrict the association with Sebi-registered entities and unregistered entities/platform. He quoted Sebi‚Äôs proposal that was approved by its Board: ‚Äúthe persons regulated by the Board and the agents of such persons shall not have any association, like any transaction involving money or money‚Äôs worth, ¬†referral of a client, ¬†interaction of information technology systems or any other association of similar nature or character, directly or indirectly, with any other person who, directly or indirectly, provides advice or recommendation or makes any implicit or explicit claim of return or performance, ¬†in respect of or related to security or securities unless permitted by the Board to provide such advice/ recommendation/claim‚ÄĚ. Surrendered registration Pickright¬†used to be a registered Investment Advisor, but according to its email to Moneycontrol, it surrendered its registration in February 2023. Its disclosure page still cites its IA Registration (INA200015635).  When asked why it is still claiming to be registered when it isn‚Äôt listed anymore as a Sebi-registered IA,¬†Pickright¬†said that compliance holds it liable for five years ‚Äútill the surrender of the page of disclosure of advisory is kept‚ÄĚ. The company has kept the disclosure on the IA registration till they surrender the page. This, according to legal experts, isn‚Äôt allowed. Nair said that once the registration is surrendered, an entity cannot continue to claim to be Sebi-registered just because it is liable for actions taken as a registered entity. ",2024-08-28 10:52

Tata Elxsi at 61 times one-year forward earnings is more than adequately factoring in all positives, the brokerage noted. Describing Tata Elxsi as an ""excellent company"" but with inflated valuations, Kotak in its latest note said near-term headwinds for the Tata Group firm have been ignored by investors so far, resulting in a significant valuation premium. This comes despite a slowdown in growth over the past two years and ongoing issues related to high client concentration. Tata Elxsistock has been on a stellar run lately, surging 26 percent in the past two days. However, analysts at Kotak believe that the stock was expensive even before the rally. The brokerage noted that valuations are inflated, factoring in over 20 percent annual compounded dollar revenue growth from FY24 to FY34. It maintained a 'Sell' rating on the stock, setting a fair value at Rs 5,500. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action ""We believe that Tata Elxsi's revenue growth would improve through the rest of FY2025E, as large OEM engagements ramp up. However, challenges in the rest of the portfolio persist: (1) weak spending in the media and communications vertical and (2) middling presence in healthcare, along with deferrals by large clients,"" Kotak said. The company has benefited from aggressive R&D spending by JLR in FY2024, with the account contributing 75 percent of the incremental revenues or 18.1 percent of overall revenues. Analysts at Kotak believe that growth for Tata Elxsi in FY25 would be more concentrated, with JLR contributing entirely to incremental revenues. ""Apart from JLR, the company needs to deepen relationships with other OEMs. There has been some progress on this aspect, with wins in SDV from a global top 5 OEM. Tata Elxsi has 34 percent of revenues from the impacted tier-1 suppliers, which remain under pressure and would partly offset revenue growth,"" Kotak said. Challenges in the rest of Tata Elxsi's portfolio are likely to continue at least over the foreseeable future, according to the brokerage note. The company runs a tight ship, optimising cost structure with industry-leading profitability, according to analysts but achieving a revenue scale of $2.6 billion is a daunting task. It is a high-quality business, but Kotak disagrees with the magnitude of the valuation premium.

The SME IPO segment was launched way back in 2012 but it has never grabbed more headlines as every other public issue seems to be creating a record in its own unique way.

Streaming service Wynk Music was launched in 2014 and allows users to download music for offline listening,Â set caller tunes, listen to podcasts, and stream music in multiple regional languages, among other features. â€śAfter launching and operating the music platform for ten years and serving 100+ million customers, Wynk will cease to exist as a standalone entity,â€ť Airtel said in an internal mass mailer to Wynk customers. Wynk is part of Airtelâ€™s digital services business and generates approximately Rs 250 to Rs 300 crore in annual revenue for the telecom company. Airtel announced on August 27 that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Apple to bring exclusive offers for its OTT video and music streaming services, Apple TV+ and Apple Music, in India. The partnership will allow Airtel Xstream customers to access content from Apple TV+ with premium Airtel WiFi and Postpaid plans. Airtel said the addition of Apple TV+ would sweeten the Airtel Xstream fibre offering. These Apple Music and Apple TV+ offers will be available exclusively to Airtel customers in India later this year. Sources said that Airtel decided to shut down Wynk's service because it did not make commercial sense to continue running itÂ without a clear monetisation plan. ""In India, music streaming monetization is already low. Secondly, Airtel wanted to offer a betterÂ service in the music streaming space. Apple is an established player in the global music streaming space,"" a person familiar with the matter told Moneycontrol. The person said that not just Airtel, the partnership will also help Apple acquire quality subscribers through this strategic partnership. ""Under the deal, Airtel will offer Apple Music subscription at a much better and discounted rate than Appleâ€™s pricing. Such plans will remain exclusive to Airtel customers and unavailable through any other telco."" The person added that Apple and Airtel are working on a carrier billing alliance as part of the partnership, which will help Apple monetize its OTT and music streaming services. In 2023, music streaming apps had a base of approximately 185 million active users. However, only around 7.5 million paid for a subscription, representing just 4 percent, according to an EY-FICCI report released in March 2024. The EY-FICCI report suggests converting to paid subscribers will be challenging because of numerous free options on major streaming platforms, all music accessible on YouTube, and FM radio in cars and mobile phones. This raises concerns about the low profitability of audio streaming platforms, which may lead to consolidation or platform shutdowns in the medium term. Airtel had previously discussed acquiring and merging Wynk with Times Internet and Tencent-backed Gaana, but the talks fizzled. Later, Gaana was acquired by Times Groupâ€™s subsidiary Entertainment Network India Limited (ENIL) in December 2023 for Rs 25 lakh. ",2024-08-28 09:38

However, Bernstein, a US-based brokerage firm, doesn't expect India to see a dramatic cycle of rate cuts. When the rate cuts do happen, analysts predict that Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) will benefit because of fixed-rate loans. On the other hand, banks could face challenges due to the slow adjustment of deposit rates. Among the banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank is seen as the least favorably positioned compared to its peers, earning it a ""market perform"" rating from Bernstein. IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank, however, are considered to be in the best position and have been rated as ""outperform."" ""We anticipate an approximate 50 basis points reduction in the current cycle, with real interest rate stabilising between 1-1.5 percent. A 50Â bps rate cut could potentially cause a short-term reduction in net interest margin by 10-15 bps,"" the brokerage firm highlighted. ALSO READ:ÂBernstein sees untapped growth in India's retail and restaurant sectors, initiates coverage on 7 companies Meanwhile, NBFCs like SBI Cards and Bajaj Finance could benefit from their significant share of fixed-rate borrowings, meaning rate cuts won't hurt their margins. Despite this, Bernstein has rated both as ""underperform."" In the recently concluded June quarter, earnings across banks, NBFCs, and insuranceÂ were stable and less worrisome, pointed out analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. They believe thatÂ Â banks loan growth was stable at ~15 percentÂ year-on-year (adjusted for merger),Â margins was stableÂ sequentially with cost of funds peaking for most players, and slippages showed no worrisome trends barring in unsecured loans such as personal, credit cards and MFI. ""Banks under coverage delivered ~15 percentÂ YoY earnings growth led by ~10 percentÂ YoY growth in operating profits and a similar growth in revenues.Â Some early signs of rising stress in unsecured loans (personal loans, credit cards and microfinance) appear to be the only key headwind in an otherwise stable lending period as deposits remain a key focus area for private banks. Meanwhile, NBFCs asset quality trends were nearly stable albeit some rise in delinquencies, which may be in line with seasonal trends,"" they added. ",2024-08-28 08:52

According to Bernstein, the spending power of the Indian middle class is not being held back by a lack of demand, but rather by the need for more affordable and accessible products - meaning, this is a supply-side issue, not one of demand.Â  This offers companies a major growth opportunity thatÂ can be tapped into right away.

However, on the retail side, Bernstein initiated coverage with an 'underperform' callÂ on Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, as the high levels of debt undertaken to acquire a wide range of brands are an area of concern. On the other hand, theÂ restaurant sector has a mixed picture. Bernstein is positive about the growth prospects for Jubilant FoodWorks and Devyani International, as a result of theÂ under-penetration in the chicken market and tight cost structures.Â Both the counters are rated as overperform, with target prices of Rs 800 for Jubilant and Rs 210 for Devyani. Westlife FoodWorld,Â the McDonald's operator in West and South India, is seen as constrained by its high capex store-opening strategy. Bernstein has rated it underperform, with a target price of Rs 700.

Cryptocurrency bitcoin took the early Asia spotlight, dropping over 6 percent after breaking below support around $60,000. But overall moves in the foreign exchange market were muted as traders awaited fresh hints on the state of the worldâ€™s largest economy. Investors are unanimous in bets that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates next month following Chair Jerome Powellâ€™s dovish tilt last week, with the debate now centred on whether or not it will be a super-sized 50-basis point cut. The current pricing sits at a 36 percent chance for the larger cut, up from 29 percent a week ago, according to the CME Groupâ€™s FedWatch Tool. Markets, which are fully priced for a 25-basis point cut next month, see just over 100 basis points worth of easing by the end of the year. A preliminary estimate for US gross domestic product in the second quarter is due later this week, along with the Fedâ€™s preferred inflation measure the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index. But with attention shifting from inflation to the strength of the economy, the importance of this weekâ€™s PCE data is ""debatable"", said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index. ""It will require a strong upside surprise to dispel expectations of multiple Fed cuts"". The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was last 0.02 percent higher at 100.61, hovering above a 13-month low of 100.51 hit in the previous session. For the month, the dollar has fallen 3.4 percent, putting it on track for its biggest monthly decline since November 2022. But given that markets have been pricing in easing from September for weeks now, downside momentum on the dollar appears to be waning, with support built up around 100.18/30, Simpson said. Sterling ticked down slightly to $1.32585 after hitting its highest since March 2022 against the greenback at $1.3269 on Tuesday. The euro slid 0.05 percent to $1.117825 and was sitting not far from a 13-month peak touched at the top of the week.

The reportÂ is based on a three-monthÂ investigation byÂ Hindenburg, which it says has revealed 'accounting red flags, evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues'. A spokesperson for Super Micro said the company â€śdoes not comment on rumours and speculation.â€ť Accounting Violations? The company was temporarily delisted from Nasdaq for failing to file financial statements in 2018, and later charged by the SEC for â€świdespread accounting violations,â€ť the Hindenburg note said, which were relating to ""$200+ million in improperly recognized revenue and understated expenses"", resulting in inflated sales, earnings and profit margins. The Hindenburg Research note also cites litigation records and interviews with ex-employees to suggest that the company re-hired executives 'directly involved in the accounting scandal', just three months after a $17.5 million SEC settlement. A former CFO of Super Micro - Howard Hideshima - was charged by the SEC with accounting violations after having left the company was hired again by a key related party owned by Super Micro CEOâ€™s brother, said the note. Related Party Transactions Two related party suppliers controlled by Super Micro CEO Charles Liangâ€™s brothers have been paid $983 million in the last three years, with one of them also partly owned by Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and his wife, said Hindenburg. Super Micro provides components to these entities which assemble and sell them back to Super Micro, and also rent warehousing and factory space to Super Micro - even though it has its own factory. Evading US Sanctions? The Hindenburg note also said that in 2006, Super Micro had pleaded guilty to a felony count of exporting banned components to Iran, which the CEO said was because the company was in its infancy and has since learned from its mistakes. The note also mentions about 45,000 transactions and alleges that Super Micro has exported high-tech components to Russia, which have risen roughly 3x since Ukraine war, 'apparently violating U.S. export bans', according to our review of more than 45,000 import/export transactions. Nvidia is a key partner and chip supplier to Super Micro, according to Hindenburg, and Tesla too had been sourcing its servers exclusively from Super Micro in 2023. However,Â accounting issues and quality concerns have resulted in major companies dropping Super Micro entirely or reducing their share of business with them, said the note. Short Position by Hindenburg Hindenburg has caveated this note with a disclosure that they have taken a short position in shares of Super Micro Computer. ""This report represents our opinion, and we encourage every reader to do their own due diligence,"" it said. Wild Swings in Share Price Earlier in August,Â Super Micro Computer reported revenue and profit below analystsâ€™ estimates, but its annual sales outlook was above Wall Street projections.Â Super Micro also announced a 10-for-1 stock splitÂ which are to start trading from October 1. The shares of Nasdaq-listed, $35 billion IT infrastructure haveÂ more than doubled this year on strong demand for servers. Still, the shares are downÂ about 48% from its peak in March.Â Super Micro's share had more than quadrupled in market value during early 2024, before collapsing almost 60% as investors began to question the pace of upmove. Hindenburg Research recently targeted Axos Financial for its exposure to risky real estate loans. In addition, Hindenburg's previous investigative report on Icahn Enterprises led to Carl Icahn and his firm agreeing to pay a $2 million settlement in connection with a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Bloomberg.Related stories.","Stocks in Asia opened lower following a sluggish day on Wall Street, as traders look to Nvidia Corp.â€™s results for clues on whether the artificial-intelligence euphoria thatâ€™s powered the bull market has more room to run. Equity benchmarks in Japan and Australia edged down Wednesday, while contracts for US shares were also lower. With the AI giant set to report earnings after Wednesdayâ€™s session, weak sentiment toward the tech sector, triggered by disappointing results earlier this week from Chinese e-commerce firm PDD, may linger. Investors are gearing up for big swings in Nvidiaâ€™s shares after the $3.2 trillion company reports. Trading in the options market implies a nearly 10% move in either direction on the day following the results. The stock has rallied about 160% this year and 1,000% from its October 2022 bear-market low. â€śWe remain bullish, but risks are now skewed to the downside over the very near-term,â€ť Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research said of markets before a key US payrolls report on Sept. 6. â€śFrom a seasonal perspective, we enter a weaker period that is even more amplified in election years.â€ť In other markets, Bitcoin fell below the $60,000 level early Wednesday as part of a broad crypto market retreat that included a sharp drop in second-largest token Ether. Oil rose after sliding on Tuesday to end a three-day rally. The S&P 500 edged higher to around 5,625 on Tuesday while the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3%. A closely watched gauge of chipmakers added 1.1%. Nvidia climbed 1.5%. Treasuries opened higher in early Asian trading after 10-year yields rose one basis point on Tuesday to 3.82% and a $69 billion US sale of two-year notes was well-received. Australian bond yields were steady ahead of the nationâ€™s monthly inflation data. With questions swirling around Federal Reserve policy, the state of the economy and the US presidential race, at least one thing seems clear on Wall Street: spending on AI is still key. Concerns about the returns of those investments recently contributed to a tech selloff, although that dip was readily bought. AI hardware and chip companies have led the bounce in the Nasdaq 100 from its August low, with Nvidia up about 30%. Nvidia accounts for more than 6% of the S&P 500â€™s market cap in terms of its index weight, so â€śitâ€™s increasingly a bigger component of where the trend and momentum of the market goes,â€ť Matt Stucky of Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management told Bloomberg Surveillance. If the giant chipmaker fails to deliver, or even just meets expectations, â€śI think itâ€™s more of a risk-off environment,â€ť he said, â€śnot necessarily fuel for rotation.â€ť Analysts, on average, are predicting that the giant chipmaker will project revenue growth of more than 70% for the current quarter. Some are estimating an even larger surge. Nvidiaâ€™s results and forecast also will serve as a barometer for AI spending across much of the technology industry. On the economic front, data showed US consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August as more upbeat views of the economy and inflation offset waning optimism about the labor market. While the S&P 500 is now nearly back to its all-time high in the wake of Powellâ€™s recent dovish message, underlying risk premia are still somewhat larger than before the July correction began and the previously all-conquering â€śAIâ€ť narrative still is yet to fully recover, according to Jonas Goltermann at Capital Economics. â€śProvided that the US economy manages a soft landing, as we continue to anticipate, and enthusiasm around AI rebounds further, we forecast the S&P 500 will hit 6,000 by the end of the year,â€ť he said.

A decision to this effect was taken at the board meeting held on Tuesday and was triggered by an ongoing case in the Delhi High Court wherein it was brought to the court's notice that the exchange has not written to the capital market regulator for an NOC for its proposed initial public offer (IPO). In response to a petition filed in the Delhi High Court related to NSE's IPO, the Sebi counsel made a submission saying that the exchange is yet to write to it for an NOC for its public issue. This assumes significance as the public issue of NSE has been pending for long as the exchange had filed its draft document way back in December 2016. Thereafter, the approval process took a hit due to regulatory probes related to the collocation scam, among other things. Also Read:ÂFPIs sell NSE shares on IPO uncertainty, derivatives volume concerns Interestingly, developments related to the listing of NSE are always closely followed as the exchange has among its shareholders many well-known global and domestic entities including state-owned insurance majors (LIC, General Insurance Corporation of India, New India Assurance Company, National Insurance Company), banks (State Bank of India) and foreign investors (Canada Pension Fund) among others.

Experts predict further consolidation in the index. As long as it stays above the 25,000 mark, levels of 25,100-25,200 can't be ruled out, with immediate support at 24,950 and crucial support at 24,700. The Bank Nifty is likely to march towards 51,500 soon, with support at 51,000. On Tuesday, the Nifty 50 rose by 7 points to 25,018, while the Bank Nifty gained 131 points to reach 51,279. On the NSE, 1,292 shares advanced, while 1,075 shares declined. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst at Samco Securities The Nifty 50 benchmark index has rebounded from its recent correction, closing above the 25,000 mark and trading just below its all-time high of 25,078. The index exhibits a strong bullish structure, with no single day's closing below the previous day's low in the last eight trading sessions, indicating sustained upward momentum. Trading above its 10- and 20-day Exponential Moving Averages (DEMA) and holding above its previous three-week highs, the index further solidifies its bullish stance. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the daily charts is firmly above 60, reinforcing the bullish momentum. Additionally, the rising window around the 24,850-24,900 levels provides crucial support. Given this robust bullish setup, a ""buy on dips"" strategy remains favourable as long as the index stays above 24,700. Key Resistance: 25,100, 25,300, 25,500 Key Support: 24,800, 24,700, 24,500. Strategy: Traders are advised to adopt a Bull Put Spread, buying the 25,000 strike Put for the September 5 expiry (1 lot) at Rs 141 and selling the 25,500 strike Put (1 lot) at Rs 468. The expected breakeven is 25,173, with a maximum profit of Rs 8,180. The target is to hold the strategy until expiry, with a stop-loss set to exit the strategy if the overall profit & loss falls below Rs 2,500. Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors The Nifty managed to break above the 25,050 level in the previous trading session but did not generate the necessary momentum, retesting the psychological level of 25,000. Both Nifty and Bank Nifty showed profit booking in the final 30 minutes, making Wednesday's opening hourly close by 10:15 AM crucial. Sustainability above the 25,070 - 25,100 range will resume the positive trend towards the Gann levels of 25,361, as long as support near 24,890 remains intact. In summary, Nifty is at a crucial juncture, with a break above the 25,070 â€“ 25,100 range potentially resuming the positive move to lifetime highs, with important support at 24,890. Key Resistance: 25,360 Key Support: 24,890 Strategy: Long positions can be created on a break above 25,080 (Nifty Futures) with a stop-loss of 24,980 and a target of 25,200, followed by 25,360 levels. Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities Nifty is approaching a crucial resistance level at 25,100, with the next significant hurdle at 25,500. The overall risk-reward ratio currently favours short positions, given the minimal upside potential as the index nears its previous all-time high resistance around the 25,100 mark. This suggests that a sell-off could be imminent. The anchor VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) indicates strong support near the 24,500 zone, where buying interest is likely to resume. Key Resistance: 25,100, 25,500 Key Support: 24,900, 24,500 Strategy: Short at the CMP of 25,017, with a stop-loss of 25,125 and a target of 24,750 and 24,500. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Dhupesh Dhameja, Derivatives Analyst at Samco Securities The Nifty Bank index has broken out of its downward-sloping parallel channel and is now consolidating above its previous trading range, signaling that itâ€™s gearing up for the next upside move. The index has established a solid base around the 50,700-50,800 levels, where the key 50-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) is positioned. Additionally, the index is trading above its short-term 10- and 20-day DEMAs, highlighting the bullish momentum. On the weekly chart, Nifty Bank has reclaimed and is trading above its 10-week Exponential Moving Average (WEMA), further strengthening momentum and providing support at lower levels. Given this confluence of positive signals, a ""buy on dips"" strategy remains favourable as long as the index stays above 50,700. Key Resistance: 51,600, 52,000, 52,500 Key Support: 50,900, 50,700,50,500 Strategy: Traders are advised to adopt a Bull Put Spread, buying the 51,100 Put for the September 4 expiry (1 lot) at Rs 309, and selling the 52,300 Put (1 lot) at Rs 1,043. The target is to hold the strategy until expiry, with a stop-loss set to exit the strategy if the overall profit & loss drops below Rs 4,000. The maximum profit can be Rs 11,019, and the expected breakeven is 51,565. Ashish Kyal, CMT, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors In the previous session, Bank Nifty made an intraday high near the 51,404 level. In the second half, profit booking was observed, which led the index to close at 51,278. Since August 16, not a single daily candle has closed below the previous dayâ€™s low, which keeps the overall outlook positive as long as prices manage to protect the previous dayâ€™s low on a closing basis. Key Resistance: 51,950 Key Support: 50,850 Strategy: Any break above 51,400 (Bank Nifty Futures) can lift the price higher towards 51,950, followed by 52,200, as long as 50,850 (Futures) holds on the downside. Riyank Arora, Technical Analyst at Mehta Equities Bank Nifty faced major resistance at 51,400, with the next hurdle at 52,000. The risk-reward scenario also favours short positions due to the limited upside, especially as the index approaches the 51,400 resistance mark. A sell-off could occur if this level holds. The anchor VWAP shows support around 50,600 and 50,450, making these levels critical for maintaining bullish momentum. Key Resistance: 51,400, 52,000 Key Support: 50,850, 50,900, 50,500, 50,000 Strategy: Short at the CMP of 51,278, with a stop-loss of 51,500, and a target of 50,600 and 50,450. ",2024-08-27 22:53

In the last one year,BPCLhas moved higher by 100.20 percent, compared to Sensex which rose 26.08 percent as per BSE. VLA Ambala, SEBI Registered Research Analyst and Co-Founder of SMT said these heightened price levels might prevail for a while, affecting oil stocksâ€™ momentum. This conflict could further aggravate market sentiments, especially now that it is in overbought conditions, as seen from the RSI readings on a monthly timeframe. Amit Goel, Co-Founder & Chief Global Strategist, Pace 360 said the market is increasingly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's potential decision to lower interest rates. A rate cut could stimulate economic activity, boost demand for oil, and consequently drive up oil prices. ""Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have raised concerns about potential disruptions to oil supply and created uncertainty about the region's oil production capacity. Such concerns can lead to increased demand for oil, pushing prices higher. The combination of these factors has improved investor sentiment toward oil stocks. As investors anticipate higher oil prices, they are more likely to buy shares in companies involved in the oil industry,"" he added.

The enormous investor interest and anticipation of quick returns from the BSE's index of Small and Medium Enterprises (BSE SME) is beyond comprehension, and reflects the 'power of money', according to Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, who believes fundamentals will prevail once this tide of money subsides. ""We have seen the power of money in the early 90s, and 2000. But we have also seen once money power goes, fundamentals prevail,"" Nilesh Shah said in a conversation with CNBC-TV18, referring to the stock market boom of the 1990s, when internet-based companies pushed valuation of technology stocks sky high, and internet IPOs created pockets of severe over-valuation. Resourceful Automobile, which operates only two Yamaha showrooms in New Delhi and employs just eight people,received a staggering 400 times subscriptionon its final day of bidding, August 26. ""The SME exchange does not have the best fundamentals to justify current prices or valuation,"" Nilesh Shah said, underscoring the fact that the BSE SME IPO index has seen a 1.4x growth this year. ""There is momentum going on, there'll be few (SME IPOs) who will be good, but majority at this valuation are unlikely to meet investors' expectations."" ""I could never imagine the kind of issues would be able to list, let alone get so much of money,"" said Nilesh Shah. Nilesh Shah cited the example of OTC Exchange Of India - an exchange set up in 1990 under the Companies Act - with which he was involved during his first job at ICICI Bank. OTCEI was tasked to give capital market access to small and medium companies, and was recognized as a stock exchange, but subsequently collapsed. Calling the SME IPO index the world's best equity index, Nilesh Shah said it has delivered a CAGR return of 66 percent for last 10 years. Jokingly, Nilesh Shah cited a comparison that the SME IPO index started three decades after Sensex, but has already pipped Sensex in terms of crossing the one lakh milestone, driving the point of the ongoing liquidity rush.

Bloomberg.Related stories.,"LG Electronics Inc. is considering an initial public offering for its India business, tapping a booming stock market to help hit a target of $75 billion in electronics revenue by 2030, Bloomberg reported. Chief Executive Officer William Cho said an Indian market debut is one of several options itâ€™s weighing to revitalize a decades-old consumer electronics business. Itâ€™s the first time the South Korean company, which competes head-on with larger rival Samsung Electronics Co., has spoken publicly about an Indian debut, the subject of persistent market and media speculation. On May 28, Moneycontrol was the first to report that LG Electronics Inc has hired advisors, namely JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, to evaluate a potential initial public offering of its unit LG Electronics India Pvt Ltd on local bourses. ALSO READ:LG Electronics India eyes IPO after Hyundaiâ€™s move; no final decision yet Cho â€” who ascended to the top post in 2021 after more than three decades with the flagship of the family-owned LG Group â€” has set a goal of growing the electronics business to an annual revenue of 100 trillion won ($75 billion) by 2030. Thatâ€™s versus overall company revenue of about $65 billion in 2023. It aims to get there in part by earning more from enterprise clients â€” targeting about 45% of sales from other companies by the end of the decade, versus 35% now. LG Electronics CEO William Cho â€śIt is one of many options we can consider,â€ť Cho told Bloomberg Television. â€śI understand thereâ€™s increased interest among global investors,â€ť he said, referring to a potential IPO in India. â€śAs of now, nothing is confirmed.â€ť In India, LG seeks to sustain rapid growth. In the first six months of this year, revenue at LGâ€™s unit within the Asian country rose 14% to a record 2.87 trillion won, while net income climbed 27% to 198.2 billion won. Any IPO would coincide with a boom in Indiaâ€™s capital markets. Some 189 companies aim to sell shares to raise $5.6 billion this year, making it one of the busiest markets in this space. At least 30 IPOs joined the pipeline as demand powered by domestic money pushes companies to explore listings. Korean peer Hyundai Motor Co. is preparing to raise as much as $3.5 billion in an Indian IPO, Bloomberg News reported this month.  â€śWe have been watching carefully whatâ€™s going on in the Indian market in terms of IPOs and following similar industry and similar IPO cases,â€ť Cho said. LG hasnâ€™t yet calculated possible valuations for its Indian unit, he added. Cho, 61, plans to nurture new businesses that can each bring in more than 1 trillion won of annual revenue. Among them is heating, ventilation and air-conditioning, for which the company has 11 production sites globally. Chillers â€” large air conditioners for buildings â€” have become key for artificial intelligence data centers, which are sprouting up across the world as companies pursue generative AI. Over the past three years, overseas sales of LGâ€™s chillers have grown 40% annually, on average. LG is also expanding its subscription service for home appliances. In Korea, consumers can rent products such as washing machines and laptops ranging from three to six years by paying a monthly fee. In theory, that improves affordability and convenience: Some 35% of consumers are now opting for subscriptions, Cho said. The company recently began offering subscriptions in Malaysia and plans to roll that model out to customers in Thailand, Taiwan and India starting this year, and potentially the US and Europe in the future. LG expects revenue from the subscription business to grow 60% to about $1.3 billion in 2024. The companyâ€™s also planning to expand its free ad-supported streaming services. Cho said LG will invest 1 trillion won by 2027 to grow its webOS-based advertising and content business. â€śHalf of my career was spent outside Korea, and it is about understanding customers and creating new business models for them,â€ť said Cho, who has worked with LG in North America, Germany and Australia.

Following a flat start, the Nifty traded within a narrow range but saw selective buying in the final hour, pushing the index to close near the dayâ€™s high at 24,770. The sectoral trend remained mixed, with FMCG, pharma, and metal sectors posting decent gains, while profit-taking in banking and financial majors limited the upside. Meanwhile, buoyancy in the small-cap space contributed to positive market breadth, settling on the advancing side. Rotational buying in heavyweights across sectors is aiding the index's gradual climb, though inconsistency in the banking majors is keeping participants cautious. On the index front, Nifty may pause around 24,850 before moving towards the 25,000+ level. In the event of a dip, we expect the index to find support in the 24,450-24,600 zone. In addition to domestic factors, we recommend closely monitoring the US markets for further cues. Jatin Gedia â€“ Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas Nifty opened on a flat note and consolidated during most part of the day. A late surge helped the Nifty to close with gains of ~71 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is heading towards 24,830 â€“ 24,900 zone. Sector rotation is helping the Nifty to stay at elevated levels. A negative divergence is developing on the momentum indicator, so the upmove is likely to be slow and might encounter intraday pullbacks. In terms of levels, 24,550 â€“ 24,500 shall act as a crucial support zone and on the upside 24,900 â€“ 24,960 shall act as an immediate hurdle from short term perspective. The Bank Nifty witnessed an intraday dip towards the crucial support zone 50,350 - 50,300 and witnessed buying interest. So, until this zone is not breached we can expect a rally in the Bank Nifty which could take it to levels of 51,000 â€“ 51,500 from short term perspective. A stop-loss of 50,300 should be maintained for the long positions. ",2024-08-27 15:52

In the afternoon trade, Zee stock jumped to an intraday high of Rs 154.9, before cooling off to Rs 147.7, still up about 10 percent from the previous close. ""As part of the settlement, the companies (Zee and Sony Pictures Networks India) have mutually agreed to withdraw all respective claims against each other, in the ongoing arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, and all related legal proceedings initiated in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and other forums,"" Zee Entertainment said in a statement. Earlier, in January this year, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) terminated a proposed $10 billion merger deal with Zee Entertainment, calling off a December 2021 agreement. Sony also sought a $90 million termination fee on account of alleged breaches by Zee Entertainment of the terms of the merger agreement. Zee too had sought termination fee of $90 million (Rs 750 crore) fromÂ SPNI and its entity Bangla Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. (BEPL) on May 23Â for pulling the plug on $10-billion merger. ""Culver Max and BEPL have failed to comply with their obligations under the Merger Cooperation Agreement (MCA). Therefore, the Company has terminated the MCA and called upon Culver Max and BEPL to pay the termination fee"", Zee had said in an exchange filing. In their statement released on August 27, the two companies said that under the terms of the settlement, none of the parties will have any outstanding or continuing obligations or liabilities to the other. ""The settlement stems from a mutual understanding between the companies to independently pursue future growthÂ opportunities with a renewed purpose and focus on the evolving media & entertainment landscape, signifying the definitive conclusion of all disputes,"" according to the statement by the two firms. The mega-merger between Zee and Sony was called off on January 22 this yearÂ andÂ one of the main reasons cited behind the $10 billion deal being derailed was the lack of consensus over who would head the merged entity. While ZEEL MD and CEO Punit Goenka earlier agreed upon as the candidate to be at the helm of the merged company, Sony reportedly sought a reconsideration after Goenka came under a SEBI probe. The merger deal had received an in-principle approval fromÂ ZEEL's board of directorsÂ in September 2021.Â One of the first legal roadblocks to the merger emerged, as the IndusInd Bank moved the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to initiate insolvency proceedings against Zee. The lender, in its petition, claimed that the Mumbai-based media company defaulted dues amounting to Rs 83.08 crore. After the merger was called off, Sony Group Corporation had initiated arbitration proceedings before Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) claiming $90 million as a termination fee saying that ZEEL failed to satisfy merger conditions and also initiated arbitration proceedings before Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC). ZEEL had also initiated legal actions to contest the claims of $90 million filed by Sony Group before SIAC. The two media firms in their recent statement have said that they have arrived at a comprehensive non-cash settlement, amicably resolving all disputes related to the merger co-operation agreement.

According toCNBC-TV18reports, LIC is seeking anÂ increase in the interest rate assumption used to calculate surrender values and is also suggesting using a plan-based Government Securities (G-Sec) benchmark for this calculation.

This marks a shift from previous regulations, which provided no surrender value in the first year and began payments only after two years of premium payments.

LIC, in its Q1FY25 investor conference call, hadÂ expressedÂ confidence in managing the impact of the new surrender value norms. TheÂ management had outlined plans to develop higher ticket size products with lower surrender value behavior to minimise any impact on margins. In the quarter ended June, LIC reported 9.6 percent rise in net profit to Rs 10,461 crore, while total premium income increased by 15.66 percent to Rs 1.1 lakh crore.Â Its net VNB margin also expanded to 13.9 percent in Q1FY25 from 13.7 percent a year back. Going ahead, analysts at JM Financial remain positive on LIC's ability to grow its non-par business and strong EV returns. The brokerage firm has maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock and set target price at Rs 1,300 apiece. Similarly, Antique Stock Broking remained bullish on LIC's growth prospects, increasing its FY25-FY27E APE growth by 6-7 percent and raised target price to Rs 1,260 apiece from Rs 1,160. So far this year, the stock of this life insurer has surged over 30 percent, outpacing Nifty 50's 15 percent rise. At current levels of 1,083, LIC is trading at 8.28x of FY24 price-adjusted book and 5.91x FY25 price-adjusted book. ",2024-08-27 13:59

""Foreign investors are shying from deploying funds into secondary market for long term and seeing better and faster return prospects in the primary market,"" said Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at SG.

E-comm firm's $55-bn stock crash sends warning on economy,"PDDŌĆÖs shares plunged 29% in their biggest fall on record, wiping out $55 billion of market value. Its closest rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. followed suit, sliding about 5% in Hong Kong. Bloomberg.Related stories.","One of the last remaining bright spots for Chinese consumption is rapidly fading, as the nationŌĆÖs economic malaise takes a toll on demand for even the most accessible of goods. In the latest warning to global markets on the health of the Chinese economy, Temu-owner PDD Holdings Inc. on Monday surprised investors with an unusually gloomy outlook. The e-commerce firm, which became a market darling with low-priced goods that helped propel sales and profits during ChinaŌĆÖs economic downturn, also reported revenue that missed estimates. During a post-earnings briefing, CEO Chen Lei mentioned at least eight times that revenue and profits must ŌĆ£inevitablyŌĆØ decline as economic growth slows. ŌĆ£We are seeing many new challenges ahead, from changing consumer demand, intensifying competition, and uncertainties in global environment,ŌĆØ Chen, also one of PDDŌĆÖs earliest employees, told analysts.  The CEO and his lieutenants were careful to stress they remained confident in Chinese consumption over the longer term ŌĆö a big priority for Beijing in rebalancing the worldŌĆÖs No. 2 economy. But the damage was done. PDDŌĆÖs shares plunged 29% in their biggest fall on record, wiping out $55 billion of market value. Its closest rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. followed suit, sliding about 5% in Hong Kong. PDDŌĆÖs warning stunned investors because the company was long viewed as the main beneficiary of a Chinese ŌĆ£consumer downgradeŌĆØ ŌĆö its low-pricing strategy on Pinduoduo domestically and Temu abroad was intended to appeal to cost-conscious shoppers at a time of unprecedented economic volatility. The disappointing results were the latest in a series of red flags about the Chinese economy. This week, popular fast food chain Din Tai Fung ŌĆö long one of the most popular restaurant brands across the country ŌĆö revealed it was shutting more than a dozen outlets. Last month, Starbucks Corp. disclosed a 14% plummet in Chinese revenue in the June quarter. ŌĆ£The big issue is weakness in China consumer,ŌĆØ said Joshua Crabb, head of Asia Pacific equities at Robeco Hong Kong Ltd. ŌĆ£The read-across for competition and a weak consumer will be negative for sure.ŌĆØ  While Starbucks and Din Tai Fung have long wrestled with volatile sentiment, PDDŌĆÖs warnings were especially surprising given it encapsulated for years how cash-strapped Chinese consumers spurned luxury brands for lower-end alternatives. Founded by ex-Google engineer Colin Huang in 2014, the company in past years has combined low prices with aggressive rural expansion and game-like elements on its platform to grab market share from Alibaba and JD. It parlayed that formula into the global e-commerce bargains app Temu, which it launched during the Super Bowl in 2023. That app has become a shopping phenom akin to Shein, becoming for a time one of the most downloaded US apps. That drove a remarkable six-fold gain in market value from the post-Covid troughs of 2022, crowning Huang ChinaŌĆÖs richest person this month. But he held the mantle for just 18 days, till MondayŌĆÖs selloff. ChinaŌĆÖs less affluent consumers outside of glitzy mega cities drove much of PDDŌĆÖs success. TheyŌĆÖre now a big source of uncertainty. Consumption, a main driver of the economy, weakened this year after a rebound in post-Covid reopening spending last year. Against the backdrop of widespread job and salary cuts as well as plunging property prices, Chinese consumers have turned more cautious with their spending, leading to intense price wars in sectors such as cars. Retail sales expanded just a little over 3% in the first seven months of 2024, far worse than the 8%-plus growth recorded in pre-pandemic times. ResidentsŌĆÖ confidence in future income plunged to the worst level since the end of 2022, one of the most intense periods of Covid lockdowns, according to a central bank survey conducted in the second quarter. Almost half of the residents polled said employment is ŌĆ£grim and difficult,ŌĆØ the highest proportion since the end of 2022. Nearly two thirds of those surveyed said theyŌĆÖre willing to save more, hovering near an all-time high recorded last year.  Lei signaled that there was a fundamental shift in consumer behavior, a move away from the bargain-basement products that have turbocharged revenue since its founding. ŌĆ£Consumers are making more thoughtful decisions to balance quality and value,ŌĆØ he said on the earnings call. ŌĆ£In response, we have collaborated with high-quality brands and manufacturers to create customized products that cater to these diverse demands.ŌĆØ For some investors, PDD executives were merely trying to contain expectations run amok. After all, it may be unreasonable to expect the company to keep logging 50%-plus growth, as itŌĆÖs done in all but one quarter on record. Wall Street was betting on PDD to almost double revenue during the June quarter. Instead, it rose 86%. On Monday, executives said they will make big investments to capitalize on future opportunities. PDDŌĆÖs result ŌĆ£implies weak consumption and intense competition. However, managementŌĆÖs comments on declining long-term profitability are too conservative, in our view,ŌĆØ Morgan Stanley analysts Eddy Wang and Kathy Zhu wrote. ",2024-08-27 13:19

Market players also want the watchdog to review the eligibility criteria so that only serious and full-time advisors are allowed to offer investment advice to investors. These are some of the suggestions that market players have given to Sebi in response to the recent consultation paper issued by the regulator to review the regulatory framework for Investment Advisers (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs). Moneycontrol reached out to various industry experts who have given their suggestions and feedback to Sebi and it appears that some of the proposals in the consultation paper have sparked debate and may require revisions before the final rules are framed. The consultation paper assumes significance as recently Sebi whole-time member Kamlesh Varshney discussed a framework to bring a large number of unregistered financial advisors â€“ finfluencers â€“ under the regulatory ambit by easing norms for IAs and RAs so that it becomes easier for more people to register themselves. One of the proposals in the Sebi paper was that IAs be allowed to provide broad asset allocation advice beyond equities, rather than recommending specific investments within those asset classes. Industry players, however, have expressed dissatisfaction with this approach. A section of market players are of the view that IAs with the necessary expertise should be allowed to offer specific advice on other asset classes, including where to invest in areas like real estate. â€śWhy limit advice to broad allocations for other asset classes? Just because Sebi doesnâ€™t regulate them doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re inherently bad,â€ť said an industry insider on conditions of anonymity. Under current regulations, IAs are permitted to advise only on securities governed by Sebi.The regulator is of the view that while some IAs have been advising on unregulated assets like real estate, gold, and tax planning, such unregulated products often lack transparency, carry hidden fees, and present potential conflicts of interest, offering limited recourse for investors. Meanwhile, the Sebi paper also proposes to review the eligibility criteria for IAs and RAs and while current norms stipulate that such entities have a postgraduate degree, the proposals suggest reducing this requirement to a graduate degree. Further, while IAs and RAs have to renew their National Institute of Securities Markets (NISM) certification every three years, the Sebi paper has proposed that renewal should be required only if there are any incremental changes. A large section of market players who have given their feedback to the regulator believes that the watchdog is relaxing the eligibility criteria a â€śbit too muchâ€ť. â€śAt least one of the two requirements should be maintained -- either a postgraduate degree or the NISM certification every three years,â€ť said Sagar Lele, co-founder of Rupeeting. â€śThe NISM exams help refresh your knowledge, and for those without a postgraduate degree in the field, taking the NISM exam is crucial for enhancing their understanding,â€ť he added. On the issue of working as a part-time IA, the consultation paper has proposed that individuals or partnership firms may be eligible for registration as part-time IA or RA if they are engaged in other business activities. Market players, however, are of the view that part-timers may not be fully dedicated to delivering IA or RA services as they could have other main businesses to run. The Sebi consultation paper was issued on August 6 and the last date for submitting feedback was August 26. The Sebi paper aimed to enable and facilitate making available the services of IAs and RAs to a wider set of audience. â€śThe ratio of investment adviser per million population in India is very low as compared to the United States which is leading to proliferation of the unregistered entities acting as IAs and RAs,â€ť stated the Sebi paper. Some of the other proposals in the paper included zero net-worth requirement, flexibility in fee-charging modes, and use of artificial intelligence, among other things. ",2024-08-27 13:02

Investing successfully consistently over a long period of time requires discipline, solid research, and patience. 2023 was a bullish year in which the Midcap 100 Index was up by 46%. Roughly 100 stocks in the midcap category were up by 80% on average. Such years create investors who think they know it all and it may lead them to an illusion that the profits are due to their investment research and stock picking skills. However, the returns generated may be just due to the overall market run-up. Portfolio analysis plays an important role during such times to understand where the profits are coming from. Case Study: Let's take 2 portfoliosÂ Portfolio 1:A randomly generated portfolio of 30 stocks. 30 random stocks were picked from the Nifty 200 Universe at the beginning of every year since 2019. All stocks were given an equal weight. Portfolio 2:Nifty 200 momentum 30 Index. This Index aims to track the performance of 30 high momentum stocks across large and mid-cap stocks. The Momentum Score for each stock is based on recent 6-month and 12-month price return, adjusted for volatility. Detailed rationale can be foundÂhere. Investing in a smart Index like Nifty 200 Momentum 30 is a much better approach than picking random stocks as the Index has generated more returns for lesser risk, consistently.  Randomly picking stocks may work better in bullish years like 2021, 2023; however, when the market breadth does not perform well it could be difficult to generate alpha from stock picking. In conclusion, ask these questions next time you think the profits in your portfolio are too good to believe: What was the process used to generate the profits? Are the profits consistent or concentrated in certain time periods? How much risk have you taken for the reward generated? How spread out were your investment bets? Have you just made money on a few stocks or the overall portfolio? The outcome of a bad process is luck. ",2024-08-27 11:44

That said, Nuvama Institutional Equities still holds a cautiously optimistic outlook for the sector, stating that the global agrochemicals industry is still reeling from pressures of high inventories and logistical challenges. The chemical industry recorded a 7 percent year-on-year topline growth in Q1, alongside a 4 percent EBITDA increase, despite a 4 percent decline in the bottomline due to margin pressures. While this earnings performance may appear modest, it offers a glimmer of hope, as it's the first time in four quarters that the sector has posted year-on-year topline growth following three consecutive quarters of sequential growth.  It was companies such as Aarti Industries,Deepak Nitrite, PI Industries, and SRF that logged year-on-year topline growth in Q1FY25. While Nuvama believes this volume-led growth momentum would continue and likely drive an uptick in prices as the year moves ahead, it also noted that profitability remains a key concern. The brokerage also highlighted the uneven recovery across different pockets of the industry. ""While discretionary sectors like dyes, pigments, and textiles sustained volume-led growth in Q1 FY25, companies catering to end-user industries such as agrochemicals faced ongoing challenges, with realisations remaining subdued due to continued destocking,"" it stated. Follow our market blog to catch all the live action Meanwhile, commentary by most managements of agrochemicals companies was also muted, hinting at an expected recovery only by the second half of FY25 due to heightened global inventories. Furthermore, the risk of Chinese oversupply poses a risk to prices, Nuvama said. Going ahead, as the recovery in the agrochemicals segment remains uncertain, NuvamaÂ is tilting in favour of companies serving discretionary end-user industries and FMCG, like Galaxy Surfactants and Aarti Industries. ""Companies such as Jubilant Ingrevia, which have expanded into new business lines, and CDMOs are expected to maintain sequential growth momentum. Additionally, players like Gujarat Fluorochemicals, focusing on new-age industry applications such as battery chemicals and semiconductors, are anticipated to enter into long-term agreements, ensuring structural growth,"" the brokerage said. On the flip side, the brokerage believes that companies like Anupam Rasayan, which is heavily reliant on agrochemicals, may continue to face pressure. ",2024-08-27 10:51

Resourceful Automobile, which operates only two Yamaha showrooms in New Delhi and employs just eight people, received a staggering 400 times subscription on its final day of bidding, August 26. The bumper response, coupled with a high grey market premium (GMP), has sparked widespread discussions on the social media platforms. The IPO, which opened on August 22, saw bids that far exceeded expectations. Resourceful Automobile operates just two Yamaha two-wheeler showrooms under the name â€śSawhney Automobilesâ€ť.Â Resourceful Automobile will list on BSE SME platform on August 29 and allotment status will be announced on August 27. The issue size of the IPO is about Rs 12 crore and official registrar to the issue is Cameo Corporate Services. According to the companyâ€™s red herring prospectus (RHP), Resourceful Automobile plans to use the IPO proceeds to fund the expansion of its operations, including the opening of two new showrooms in the Delhi-NCR region, debt repayment, and covering working capital needs. The company, headquartered in Delhi, specialises in the sale and servicing of Yamaha motorcycles and scooters, and has a small workforce of eight employees. Of these, three handle finance and legal matters, two manage sales and marketing, one oversees HR and administration, while the remaining two are responsible for operations. Despite this limited operational scale, the companyâ€™s IPO has garnered massive attention. Traders and retail investors alike were mystified at the outsized subscription figures for a firm with such a modest footprint. According to multiple websites that track the grey market premium activities, the shares were commanding a premium of up to 70 percent in the unlisted market. However, the high GMP has also triggered caution among traders on X who are voicing their concerns. A number of voices on X raised questions about the logic behind the frenzy. One trader, Akshay Jogani, expressed his disbelief, tweeted, â€śResourceful Automobile SME IPO is crazy. Two Yamaha dealership showrooms, eight employees. Asking â‚ą12 Cr, got ~â‚ą2700 Cr in bids. Market cap ~â‚ą31 Cr at IPO price on a net worth of ~â‚ą1.5 Cr. Yet, 227x subscribed.

The high liquidity and oversubscription have baffled market observers, who are unsure if the response is based on sound fundamentals or driven purely by speculation. Viral Nagda, another trader, noted the dissonance between the companyâ€™s recent performance and the current market enthusiasm. He tweeted, â€śIndian Markets Hit Fever Pitch as Resourceful Automobile's IPO is Oversubscribed by 200x Despite Negative Cash Flow. #ResourcefulAutomobile sought â‚ą12 Cr, received â‚ą2400 Cr.

This surge led to a higher plant load factor (PLF) for coal, gas, nuclear, and renewable energy segments. Additionally, coal dispatches to the power sector increased by 25.7Â percent YoY, reaching 65.5 metric tonnes. However, analysts at JM Financial noted that peak power demand and energy consumption across India moderated by nearly 5 percent YoY in August 2024, influenced by various factors such as extended holidays (like Independence Day and a long weekend) and heavy rains in certain regions. Despite this dip, the PLF of coal-fired power plants continued to improve, reaching 68Â percent in July 2024, up from 64Â percent in July 2023.

Meanwhile, a total of 89 GW of renewable energy projects, along with 8 GW, 18 GW, and 28 GW of nuclear, hydro, and thermal projects, respectively, are currently under construction. For the quarter ended June, NTPC reported an 11 percent YoY increase in standalone net profit, reaching Rs 4,511 crore, while consolidated revenue rose 13.5Â percent YoY to Rs 44,419 crore. CESCâ€™s net profit grew 5.4Â percent YoY to Rs 388 crore in Q1FY25, with revenue from operations increasing 12.8Â percent YoY to Rs 4,863 crore. Inox Wind also made a turnaround, posting a profit of Rs 50 crore after a loss of Rs 65 crore in the previous quarter. The companyâ€™s total revenue surged by 85Â percent YoY to Rs 651 crore in Q1FY25. ",2024-08-27 09:07

Cooling crude to lift IndiGo, Shilpa Medicare, Bikaji Foods in focus","With the Jackson Hole symposium hinting at a potential easing of monetary policy, the outlook for gold could become even more favorable.Related stories.","All that glitters is not gold, and this saying has proven true for the government. The Reserve Bank of India recently announced premature redemption of Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) issued between May 2017 and March 2020. Street chatter has it that not only is the government opting for early withdrawals, but it might also be hesitant to issue any more SGB tranches. Hereâ€™s the scoop: back in 2015, the RBI and the government launched SGBs with a clear goalâ€”curb Indiaâ€™s insatiable appetite for gold, reduce imports, and help control the ballooning current account deficit. Instead of buying physical gold, investors could invest in bonds that earned a fixed annual interest of 2.5 percent, with any returns made after the bondâ€™s eight-year maturity being completely tax-free. The SGBs were a hit right out of the gate. In the first year alone, the government issued three series, continuing to roll out new bonds as gold prices climbed. But thereâ€™s a twist: SGBs are most beneficial when gold prices remain stable or increase gradually. If gold prices soar, the government ends up paying much more than anticipatedâ€”and thatâ€™s exactly what happened. When the government raised Rs 245 crore from the first batch of SGBs in 2015, gold was priced at Rs 2,684 per gram. By the time those bonds matured, gold prices had more than doubled to Rs 6,132 per gram. This meant that the RBI had to pay out significantly more, plus the interest accrued over the years. While this price surge was great news for investors, it threw a wrench in the governmentâ€™s original plan to cheaply raise funds for its initiatives and manage the growing current account deficit. What started as a cost-effective strategy turned into a costly dilemma, with SGB values more than doubling in less than eight years. Out of the 67 tranches of SGBs issued so far, only four have matured, leaving the government to face 63 more tranches set to mature in the coming years. With the Jackson Hole symposium hinting at a potential easing of monetary policy, the outlook for gold could become even more favorable. It remains to be seen whether more SGBs will be issued and how the government plans to navigate this financial conundrum. Soft crude can give IndiGo a profitable lift Analysts at ICICI Securities highlighted that any drop in crude oil prices could breathe new life into aviation stocks, with Interglobe Aviation (IndiGo) set to gain the most. In the first quarter of FY25, the average price of Brent crude oil was $84 per barrel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) was around Rs 1 lakh per kiloliter. By August 23, 2024, the price of Brent crude had dropped to $78.2 per barrel, and the average ATF price for August was Rs 97,945 per kiloliter. What does this mean for Indigo? If fuel prices per available seat kilometer (ASK) fall by 10 percent, the difference between revenue per available seat kilometer (RASK) and cost per available seat kilometer (CASK) would jump to Rs 0.52. In that case, IndiGo's profit before tax (PBT) would rise by 36 percent to Rs 12,200 crore. And if fuel prices drop by 20 percent, the RASK-CASK spread would increase to Rs 0.69, boosting PBT by a whopping 72 percent to Rs 15,500 crore. Shilpa Medicare (Rs 731.55, +5%) Successful phase 3 clinical trials of fatty liver drug SMLNUD07, known as NorUDCA Bull case:Robust pipeline of complex, high-margin drugs set to come into the mix by FY26, with several products currently under clinical trials. Sharp spike in institutional shareholding in the stock during the June quarter ushers further confidence. Bear case:With several drugs caught in different phases of clinical trials, the company is extremely privy to regulatory risks. Heavy dependence on 10 customers for its CDMO business can also pose a downside risk to earnings growth. Bikaji Foods (Rs 855, 0.04%) Acquired 55 percent stake in Ariba Foods Bull Case:Bikaji can tap into Ariba's preexisting distribution network. Acquistion is in-line with Bikaji's strategy to develop and expand the frozen snacks business in India. Bear Case:Falling demand for quick-service food might impact the topline. Bikaji could face difficultiesd in shifting some production to Ariba's manufacturing in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. Export sales contribute to 50 percent of Ariba's sales, any chances in taxation or import laws in other countries can impact margins. (with inputs from Vaibhavi and Zoya) ",2024-08-27 08:28

Canada will impose 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs. Ikea launches ""Ikea Preowned,"" a platform for buying and selling used furniture. Temu parent PDD Holdings' stock plummets amid revenue misses. US semiconductor stocks fall as Nvidiaâ€™s results approach. Appleâ€™s September 9 event will unveil new devices. All this and more on this edition of World Street. iChange Begins Apple has announced that Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri will be succeeded by current Apple executive Kevan Parekh on January 1. Maestri, who became CFO in 2014, has overseen a remarkable period of growth, with Appleâ€™s stock surging over 800 percent since his appointment, fueled by strong demand for iPhones. He will remain with the company, overseeing teams focused on IT, security, and real estate development. Canada Clamps Canada will follow the United States and European Union by imposing a 100 percent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles. Additionally, a 25 percent tariff will be applied to imported steel and aluminum from China. The tariffs will impact all EVs shipped from China, including those produced by Tesla, a Canadian government official said. Canadian imports of automobiles from China through Vancouver surged 460 percent YoY to 44,356 units in 2023, coinciding with Teslaâ€™s shipments of Shanghai-made EVs to Canada. Second SmĂ¶rgĂĄsbord Ikea is venturing into the second-hand market with the launch of ""Ikea Preowned,"" a peer-to-peer marketplace allowing customers to buy and sell used furniture directly. This move puts the Swedish giant in direct competition with established platforms like eBay, Gumtree, and Craigslist. The platform will initially be tested in Madrid and Oslo until the end of the year, with plans for a global rollout, as confirmed by Jesper Brodin, Chief Executive of Ingka, the main operator of Ikea stores. Temu Trouble PDD Holdings, the parent company of the fast-growing Temu shopping app, saw its stock plummet over 30%, wiping out more than $50 billion in market value. The e-commerce giant reported disappointing revenue and warned of intense competition and other challenges that could slow growth and profits. PDD has faced scrutiny from governments, including the U.S., which appears to be impacting its outlook. Despite rapid growth, with revenue reaching over $13.6 billion, it fell short of analysts' expectations of $14 billion. The company's executives further unnerved investors by forecasting a tough road ahead. Nvidia Nerves U.S. semiconductor stocks dropped on Monday as investors braced for Nvidiaâ€™s upcoming financial results, set to be released on Wednesday. Nvidia, a major driver of 2024's record stock market run, has seen massive gains thanks to its AI-powered growth. Analysts expect its second-quarter revenue and earnings to more than double from last year. With Nvidiaâ€™s significant influence on major indexes, any big move in its stock could impact the broader market. iCountdown Apple will host a press event at its Cupertino headquarters on September 9, where it's expected to unveil new iPhones and Apple Watch models. The event will be streamed on Appleâ€™s website and YouTube. Apple traditionally reveals its latest devices in the fall, just in time for the holiday shopping season. Since 2020, the tech giant has opted for pre-recorded video launches.

According to experts, if the index holds 25,000 amid likely consolidation, the 25,100-25,400 levels are the ones to watch in the coming sessions, while immediate support lies in the 24,900-24,800 zone. For the Bank Nifty, 51,500 is expected to be a hurdle on the higher side, with support at 51,000. On Monday, the Nifty 50 jumped 188 points to 25,011, and the Bank Nifty climbed 215 points to 51,148. On the NSE, 1,244 shares advanced, while 1,167 shares declined. Nifty Outlook and Strategy Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities The Nifty has managed to close above the 25,000 level, indicating that the probability of a new lifetime high is quite high. The momentum indicator MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) is well in buy mode on the daily and weekly charts, indicating that the short-term trend is positive. From a derivatives perspective, the options data indicates that the immediate support is pegged in the range of 24,800 to 25,000 levels, whereas the immediate resistance is now pegged in the range of 25,200 to 25,400 levels. The PCR (Put Call Ratio) is trading well above the 1 level, at 1.23, and the index is also trading well above its maximum pain levels at 24,900, hence the overall trend looks positive. As long as the 24,800 level is not broken in the near term on a closing basis, the short-term trend remains positive for fresh highs. Key Resistance: 25,200, 25,400 Key Support: 24,900, 24,800 Strategy: Buy with a stop-loss of 24,800, and aim for targets of 25,200 and 25,400. Mehul Kothari, DVP â€“ Technical Research at Anand Rathi From a technical standpoint, we are currently observing a Double Top formation at these levels, and the RSI (Relative Strength Index) on the daily chart is indicating a potential three-point negative divergence. Looking ahead, while a move above 25,100 on the Nifty 50 could extend the rally towards 25,200 â€“ 25,400, it would be prudent to consider booking profits in individual stocks at these higher levels. For the short term, the new support level to watch is 24,800 in the upcoming sessions. Key Resistance: 25,100, 25,200 Key Support: 24,800, 24,600 Strategy: Buy Nifty Futures above 25,100, with a stop-loss of 24,990 and a target of 25,200 - 25,300. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart The Nifty is currently exhibiting strong bullish momentum, with the 25,000-25,080 range serving as an immediate and crucial resistance zone. If the index struggles to break through this level, a phase of profit booking may ensue. However, a decisive move above 25,080 could open the door for a rally towards the 25,250 mark. On the downside, the 24,880-24,770 range acts as an immediate demand zone. If this level is breached, the next significant support lies at the 20-day moving average (20-DMA) of 24,550. Key Resistance: 25,080, 25,250 Key Support: 24,880, 24,770, 24,550 Strategy: Consider buying on dips near 24,880, with a stop-loss at 24,550 and a target of 25,250. Bank Nifty - Outlook and Positioning Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities The Bank Nifty too has closed well above the 51,000 level, where there were multiple swing resistances as well as the highest open interest in the Call front. Now, since those levels have been taken out, the next resistance on the upside is at 51,500, with immediate support at 51,000 and below that at 50,500 levels. If the Bank Nifty manages to surpass 51,500, it is very likely to inch towards 52,000 levels. The PCR is at 0.77, indicating that the bears have the upper hand. However, there was clear Call unwinding at the lower strikes (i.e., 51,000, 50,900, and 50,800), along with clear addition in Puts at almost all strikes, with the maximum at 51,200, indicating a high probability of an upside from here. The index has closed well above its VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) level of 51,000, which is positive in the short term. Key Resistance: 51,500, 52,000 Key Support: 51,000, 50,800 Strategy: Buy with a stop-loss of 50,800, and target levels of 51,500 and 52,000 Mehul Kothari, DVP â€“ Technical Research at Anand Rathi Although the Nifty Bank index managed to close well above the 51,000 mark, it did not confirm a breakout. A close above 51,200 would have validated a breakout from the falling channel pattern. However, the index fell short of this level in Mondayâ€™s session. Consequently, further upside is anticipated only if the index moves above 51,300 in the spot market or closes above 51,200. On the downside, a breach of the 51,000 level could trigger some profit-taking in the near term. Key Resistance: 51,300, 51,700 Key Support: 51,000, 50,700 Strategy: Wait and watch or buy above 51,300 in spot. Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart Bank Nifty has established a strong base at its 100-day moving average (DMA) and is currently trading above the 20-day moving average (DMA). However, the 51,100 to 51,500 range is a crucial supply zone. A breakout above 51,500 or a dip below 50,500 will likely determine the next significant trend in the market. Key Resistance: 51,500, 52,000 Key Support: 51,000, 50,550, 50,000 Strategy: Consider buying on dips near 51,000, with a stop-loss at 50,550 and a target of 52,000. ",2024-08-27 00:07

The increasing PCR, or being higher than 0.7 or surpassing 1, means traders are selling more Put options than Call options, which generally indicates the firming up of a bullish sentiment in the market. If the ratio falls below 0.7 or moves towards 0.5, then it indicates selling in Calls is higher than selling in Puts, reflecting a bearish mood in the market.  9)India VIX Volatility maintained its uptrend for another session but remained below the 15 mark.

The market is likely to consolidate, but the overall trend remains in favour of the bulls. Here are some trading ideas for the near term: Jay Thakkar, Vice President & Head of Derivatives and Quant Research at ICICI Securities Hindustan Unilever| CMP: Rs 2,821  HUL has provided a breakout from a significant sideways consolidation, forming a classical symmetrical triangular pattern. The momentum indicator MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) has returned to buy mode on both daily and monthly charts, which is quite positive in the short to medium term. From a derivatives perspective, the stock has seen a good long buildup since the July series. Regarding options data, the stock has surpassed its crucial hurdle of Rs 2,800 and closed above it, where it has the highest open interest on the Call option front. It has also seen significant buildup on the Put side, and the PCR (Put Call Ratio) is still oversold at 0.56, suggesting there could be a sharp upmove from here. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,920, Rs 2,960 Stop-Loss: Rs 2,759 Alkem LaboratoriesSeptember Futures | CMP: Rs 5,829  Alkem has provided a breakout from sideways consolidation with a bullish crossover in its MACD on daily, weekly, and monthly charts. The breakout has occurred, and the retest seems to be complete. The breakout was accompanied by an increase in volumes, indicating a price-volume breakout. Since the July series, the stock has seen a good long buildup, which is positive. Although there were shorts seen last week, the increase in volumes during the last trading session increases the probability of an upside. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 6,000, Rs 6,100 Stop-Loss: Rs 5,739 Tata SteelSeptember Futures | CMP: Rs 156.2  Tata Steel is expected to retrace its overall 3-wave corrective zigzag pattern formed on the daily charts. The momentum indicator MACD has entered buy mode on the daily charts, which is quite positive in the short term. A minimum of 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement is expected, which comes to Rs 161.51, and above that, the 50 percent retracement level comes to Rs 165. The stock has witnessed short buildup since almost the June series and now appears oversold, hence a bounce back in terms of short covering is expected. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 161.51, Rs 165 Stop-Loss: Rs 153.21 Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart Titan Company| CMP: Rs 3,630  Titan Company is witnessing multiple bullish setups, including a breakout of a symmetrical triangle formation. It is also forming higher highs and higher lows, making it attractive for long-term investors as it has closed above the 200-DMA (Days Moving Average) on the longer timeframe. It is building a strong base in a cluster of 20, 50, and 100-DMA at around Rs 3,400. On an immediate basis, Rs 3,800 is the horizontal resistance line; above this, we can expect a rally towards the Rs 4,000 level. On the downside, Rs 3,400 is immediate and strong support. Momentum indicators are positively poised to support the current trend strength. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 3,800, Rs 4,000 Stop-Loss: Rs 3,400 Prakash Industries| CMP: Rs 230.88  Prakash Industries is in a classical uptrend and is now breaking out of a triangle formation to resume its uptrend. The breakout coincides with rising volume, and it has managed to sustain above the breakout level. The structure of the counter is very attractive, as it is trading above all of its moving averages. MACD supports the current strength, while the momentum indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index) is also positively poised. On the higher side, Rs 250 acts as a crucial level, and above this, we can expect a long move towards Rs 280+ in the shorter to longer timeframe, while on the lower side, Rs 200 serves as important support during any correction. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 250, Rs 280 Stop-Loss: Rs 200 ITC| CMP: Rs 505.70  ITC has experienced a breakout from a multi-year resistance on the longer timeframe and has closed above the Rs 500 level. It is currently forming an ascending triangle pattern on the daily chart, suggesting potential continued upward momentum. The immediate resistance is at the previous swing high around Rs 510, and a break above this level could lead to a near-term target of Rs 540. On the downside, the immediate support is at the recent breakout level of Rs 500, with a strong demand zone around Rs 490. Momentum indicators are showing positive signals, indicating that the current trend's strength is likely to continue. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 540 Stop-Loss: Rs 500 Mehul Kothari, DVP â€“ Technical Research at Anand Rathi Shriram Pistons & Rings| CMP: Rs 2,104  Shriram Pistons is trading in a strong uptrend. During Fridayâ€™s session, a range breakout above the Rs 2,100 mark was witnessed, followed by a retracement during Mondayâ€™s session. The weekly and long-term charts depict a buy-on-dips trend. Thus, traders are advised to buy the stock between Rs 2,100 and Rs 2,000 for a target of Rs 2,300 in the coming weeks. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 2,300 Stop-Loss: Rs 1,900 Kokuyo Camlin| CMP: Rs 199.7  In Mondayâ€™s session, a fresh range breakout was witnessed in Kokuyo Camlin above the Rs 195 mark, and it was achieved at an all-time high. The price action was supported by exceptional volumes of over 15 lakh, compared to the usual volume of just 3â€“4 lakh in the stock. The daily ADX (Average Directional Index) has crossed 25 and is now near 29, indicating more strength. Thus, traders are advised to accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 198â€“190 for a target of Rs 224. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 224 Stop-Loss: Rs 179 Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem| CMP: Rs 1,000  Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem has been in a corrective mode for the past two years, coming down from the peak of Rs 2,600. On the daily scale, after the fall was arrested, a double bottom formation was witnessed. Along with that, there is also a positive divergence on the weekly RSI. Thus, traders are advised to buy the stock above Rs 1,020 for a target of Rs 1,120 in the coming weeks. Strategy: Buy Target: Rs 1,120 Stop-Loss: Rs 970 ",2024-08-26 21:09

The operations of the debenture trustee (DT) between March 31, 2023, and October 31, 2023, were looked into as part of Sebi's examination of breach of convenants (or terms of an issue) by the NBFC. In the order dated August 26, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said that, when there was a breach or default, the debenture trustee had not communicated that to all the securities holders and that it had not organised a meeting for all of them. The order also said that it had not informed the concerned credit rating agency (CRA) in time. In the order, the regulator asked the DT to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh. Also read:ÂSebi's FPI Disclosure Rules: Large FPIs fully compliant, investors with concentrated holdings on shopping spree, say sources On the violation when communicating with the securities holders, the order said, ""the Noticee (the debenture trustee) had communicated the event of default to some of the debenture holders and the meeting was also conducted by it.

""Further, it is noted that the Noticee has not provided any document in support of having communicated all the debenture holders via RPAD/SPAD or Courier in addition to the email communication,"" said the order. As the order noted, intimating one or few debenture holders and merely submitting that the debenture holders were intimated cannot be construed as a proper communication. On its communications with the CRA, the order noted, "" (the regulator's finding) conspicuously shows that the Noticee didnâ€™t share any information upfront with India Ratings despite breach of covenants observed by it on June 20, 2023 and therefore, submission of the Noticee is devoid of merits."" The order noted that the ""material available on record has not quantified the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, if any"" made by the DT and the loss, if any, suffered by investors. It also noted that the DT had not been penalised by Sebi in the past. The order also stated, ""The Noticee being a registered intermediary is expected to adhere to fair practices and maintain a high degree of professionalism in the conduct of its business."" ""Further, it is pertinent to that the role of a DT is crucial as it is primarily responsible to ensure that the interest of the debenture holders is not hampered by the issuer companies. Much power is given to trustees as they stand as a protector for the investors.
