The reference to fairies comes from Lord KeynesŌĆÖ speech at the inaugural meeting of the World Bank and IMF, at Savannah in the US, in March 1946. Keynes, fresh from a performance of TchaikovskyŌĆÖs ballet ŌĆśSleeping BeautyŌĆÖ, said he hoped the Bretton Woods twins, Master Fund and Miss Bank, would receive three gifts from their fairy godmothers: first, a many-coloured coat ŌĆ£as a perpetual reminder that they belong to the whole worldŌĆØ; second, vitamins for ŌĆ£energy and a fearless spirit, which does not shelve and avoid difficult issues, but welcomes them and is determined to solve themŌĆØ; third, ŌĆ£a spirit of wisdomŌĆ” so that their approach to every problem is absolutely objectiveŌĆØ. Carter writes that Keynes celebrated the co-operation among nations at Bretton Woods as a ŌĆśŌĆÖvictory for the human spiritŌĆÖŌĆÖ. He quotes Keynes, who told the conference that, ŌĆ£We have been learning to work together. ŌĆ”If we can so continue, this nightmare, in which most of us here present have spent too much of our lives, will be over. The brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase.ŌĆØ After the horrors of the Second World War, a longing for the brotherhood of man was inevitable. But the Soviet Union did not sign the Bretton Woods agreement and within a few years, the Korean War had broken out, putting an end to such fond hopes. To be honest, though, Keynes also┬Āwarned the delegates that ŌĆ£there is scarcely any enduringly successful experience yet of an international body which has fulfilled the hopes of its progenitorsŌĆØ. And he went on to say, again referring to the Sleeping Beauty tale, that he hoped ŌĆ£there is no malicious fairy, no Carabosse, whom he has overlooked and forgotten to ask to the party. For if so the curses which that bad fairy will pronounce will, I feel sure, run as follows: ŌĆ£You two brats shall grow up politicians; your every thought and act should have anarri├©re-pens├®e; everything you determine shall not be for its own sake or on its own merits but because of something else.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ Keynes had tasted defeat at the Bretton Woods conference, where all his proposals were shot down by the Americans, who were intent on ensuring US hegemony through the almighty dollar. Indeed, Robert Skidelsky, in his book on Keynes, wrote, ŌĆ£Frederic Vinson, the US Secretary of the Treasury, took it personally. ŌĆśI donŌĆÖt mind being called malicious, but I do mind being called a fairy,ŌĆÖ he growled.ŌĆØ Why bring up Bretton Woods now? The answer perhaps lies inanother article┬Āin this monthŌĆÖs ŌĆśFinance & DevelopmentŌĆÖ magazine, by former British prime minister Gordon Brown. He writes, ŌĆ£Global challenges that require global solutions are ever present, whether a changing climate or rising cyber threats. And just as we are facing these challenges, the three pillars of the postŌĆōCold War era anchoring the global systemŌĆöunipolarity, hyperglobalisation, and neoliberal economicsŌĆöare collapsing around us. These seismic shifts are sowing the seeds of a new wave of populist nationalism exemplified by the ŌĆ£America FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£Russia FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£India FirstŌĆØ, ŌĆ£China FirstŌĆØ, and often ŌĆ£my country first and onlyŌĆØ movements springing up round the world.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ We have moved a long way from the spirit of the Bretton Woods conference and are back to the beggar-thy-neighbour protectionist policies of the period between the World Wars. But many would question the assumption that the Bretton Woods institutions were anything other than an extension of US power. The IMFŌĆÖs forcing of austerity down the throats of nations in trouble has come in for much criticism. Indeed, as Carter writes, ŌĆ£KeynesŌĆÖs greatest fear for the Fund and the BankŌĆ” was that the ŌĆ£twinsŌĆØ would become instruments of US power rather than truly independent international bodiesŌĆÖŌĆÖ. As US economist Benn Steil shows in his book, ŌĆśThe Battle of Bretton WoodsŌĆÖ, far from being an embodiment of the human spirit, the Bretton Woods conference was full of intrigue, acrimony and rivalry, and it contains a wealth of anecdotes and quotes, some of which have been reproducedhere. For example, Keynes had remarked to British economist Richard Kahn at the Savannah meeting: ŌĆ£The Americans have no idea how to make these institutions into operating international concerns,ŌĆ” ┬Āand in almost every direction their ideas are bad. Yet. they plainly intend to force their own conceptions on the rest of us. The result is that the institutions look like becoming American concerns, run by gigantic American staffs, with the rest of us very much on the side-lines.ŌĆØ In a lecture delivered at the London School of Economics, Paul Bareau, a member of the British Treasury delegation to Washington, asserted that Keynes said, ŌĆ£I went to Savannah to meet the world, and all I met was a tyrant.ŌĆØ And in a letter to the Foreign Office, Keynes said they had to sign the Bretton Woods agreement without reading it because their hosts had made arrangements to throw them out of the hotel. Brotherhood of man, indeed! Keynes also detested Harry Dexter White, the leader of the US team at Bretton Woods and most of the other Americans there. Perhaps most scathing was this remark about Mariner Eccles, the Fed chairman: ŌĆ£No wonder that man is a Mormon. No single woman could stand him.ŌĆØ Nope, Bretton Woods was not about idealism or the spirit of brotherhood. The twin institutions were to be the instruments of US power and the US view was bulldozed through. Paul Bareau said, ŌĆ£We [the British] lost on every issue, not by the process of rational argument in debate but by the solid massing of the cohorts which voted automatically with America, [particularly the Latin Americans,] whose representatives could be depended on to read sometimes with considerable difficulty the speeches prepared for them by the Secretariat of the United States delegation.ŌĆØ The simple fact is that in Bretton Woods, the US prepared the ground to take over BritainŌĆÖs role as the worldŌĆÖs greatest power. US historian John Morton Blum wrote: ŌĆ£Congress was spontaneously more generous towards China than towards England, perhaps because no one envisaged China as a postwar rival for power or commerce.ŌĆØ The wheel has turned full circle and China is now AmericaŌĆÖs bete noire, just as Japan had become in the eighties. Keynes died within a month of the Savannah meeting, at the early age of 62. The irony was that his American rival at Bretton Woods, Harry Dexter White, was later accused of being a Soviet agent. In August 1948, two days after testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee, where he denied being a Communist, he died of a heart attack, aged 55. It is time for soberly facing up to reality, to realise that the world has become a far more dangerous place, to acknowledge that the rules of the game have changed. Instead, the markets are ignoring the increase in risks, preferring to believe in fairy dust. Asthis FT story┬Ātells us, ŌĆ£The medium-term future for globalisation seems set: a struggle between Washington and Beijing for pre-eminence, or at least resilience, which continually threatens to override economic efficiency with national security.ŌĆÖŌĆÖ Gordon Brown, in his Finance and Development article, says ŌĆ£a power-based order is replacing a rules-based orderŌĆÖŌĆÖ.

The insurer plans to build out its partnership with Shriram Capital Group in the South Asian nation by adding an equal joint venture covering wealth and advice services, doubling down on an initial 2005 investment that has already delivered results in the credit and insurance spaces. â€śA large number of people are breaking out of the real poverty trap, so theyâ€™re able to start focusing on providing for the future,â€ť Sanlam Chief Executive Officer Paul Hanratty said in an interview Thursday. â€śIndia is really at that point where a huge chunk of the population are now able to save and invest for the future.â€ť The International Monetary Fund expects Indiaâ€™s $3.9 trillion economy to expand 6.8% this year. That compares with a forecast for 0.9% growth for South Africa, Sanlamâ€™s home market. The South Asian nation is expected to generate $730 billion of wealth through 2028, according toÂ Boston Consulting Group, and thatâ€™s enticing firms including HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc to expand. State Bank of India, which has more than 22,500 branches in the country, is deploying 2,000 bankers toÂ woo the rich. Blackrock Inc., the worldâ€™s biggest fund manager, in April signed an equal joint venture with billionaire Mukesh Ambaniâ€™s Jio Financial Services Ltd. to set up a wealth-management business and also form a brokerage company in India. The two entities formed a joint venture to set up an Indian asset-management business in July 2023. â€śThatâ€™s a very hot area in India â€” everybodyâ€™s trying to get into it and we are very well positioned to start up,â€ť Hanratty said. â€śWeâ€™ve got a huge distribution footprint, so weâ€™ve just got to get the business and the proposition right, and then just gradually start growing it into our existing basis of branches and customers.â€ť For the six months ended June 30, Sanlamâ€™s India business generated about 16% of profit, up from 10% in 2021. The insurer said headline earnings climbed 43% in the period from a year earlier, buoyed by gains in life and health insurance, a surge in general insurance, and a recovery in investment management. The so-called net result from financial services â€” the companyâ€™s preferred profit measure â€” rose 19% per share. â€śThe operating environment has been a little bit better in the first half of 2024,â€ť Hanratty said, citing the successful conclusion of South Africaâ€™s elections in May, where the inability to produce an outright winner saw the African National Congress â€” which has ruled the country since 1994 â€” establish a multiparty government with nine other entities.

The worldâ€™s largest artificial-intelligence chipmaker shed a fifth of its value over the past two weeks. The declines also showcase a more pressing issue for investors in the $2.5 trillion giant: Its volatility now dwarfs its Magnificent Seven peers and makes Bitcoin look like a port of calm. Nvidia shares have swung between $90.69 and $131.26 over the past 30 trading days, with a record amount of market value being wiped out Tuesday. That level of gyration drove its 30-day realized volatility up to about 80 â€” roughly four times the level of Microsoft Corp., double Bitcoinâ€™s figure and higher than meme stocks like Donald Trumpâ€™s media company and Elon Muskâ€™s Tesla Inc.  The stumble has pushed the stock to its worst two-week stretch in two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The declines came after a tepid forecast and issues for its Blackwell chip, which dented investor euphoria. Then came news that the US Justice Department sent subpoenas in an escalating antitrust probe. Adding to the gloom for chipmakers broadly, Broadcom Inc. released a disappointing sales forecast. â€śYouâ€™re just in a very difficult market environment right this second,â€ť said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management LLC, adding that the AI trade is still in its early days. Still, â€śon a day-to-day basis, where the bottom is, is anybodyâ€™s guess.â€ť Rewarding Year Of course, the stock has rewarded investors handsomely this year, even with the recent slide. The shares are still up more than 100% this year, adding $1.3 trillion in market value. And Wall Street roundly expects that Nvidia remains well positioned as companies build out infrastructure related to AI, a process thatâ€™s expected to last for several more quarters at least. Nvidiaâ€™s biggest customers â€” notably Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc., which together comprise more than 40% of Nvidiaâ€™s revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show â€” affirmed their spending plans in their most recent quarters. Nvidiaâ€™s results last week confirmed this rosy view. Revenue more than doubled and came in better than expected, as did adjusted earnings. The company also gave a revenue forecast that beat the analyst consensus, though it failed to meet the high end of estimates.  That result underwhelmed market participants who had grown accustomed to blowout reports. It also fed into concerns for those who are skeptical about the long-term outlook for spending on AI. It all means that as investors digest the evolution of the AI theme, the volatility in shares of Nvidia and other chipmakers will likely persist. For money managers who want to get in for the long haul, that could spell opportunity. â€śFor a long-term investor, this is a good time to start picking away,â€ť said Williams at Wayve Capital. â€śIf somebody handed me new money today, I would be enthusiastically adding some AI-related stocks.â€ť ",2024-09-07 06:58

It closed in the red down ~280 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty on account of the fall has reached the crucial support zone 24850 â€“ 24800 which coincides with the 20-day moving average and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. We expect the Nifty to hold on to this support zone and hence shall continue to maintain our short-term positive stance on the Nifty. The immediate hurdle is placed at 25000. The Banking sector led the fall in todayâ€™s trading session. It has decisively closed below the short-term averages and the daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sell signal. Thus, pullback is likely to get sold into. In terms of levels, 50800 â€“ 50949 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone while 50000 â€“ 49700 is the crucial support zone from short term perspective.

After a flat start, the Nifty gradually declined throughout the day, breaking multiple support levels to end at 24,852.15. The sell-off was broad-based, with the banking and energy sectors taking the biggest hit. Broader indices also saw declines, losing more than a percent each. The recent weakness in US markets has stalled the momentum in Indian markets, causing participants to become cautious ahead of the upcoming jobs data. With the Nifty slipping below the crucial 20-day exponential moving average (DEMA), further downside is likely, with key support around 24,500 at the 50 DEMA.

According to him, the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. As far as top bets are concerned, he remains positive on consumer-related stocks. Additionally, he holds a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals, said the seasoned investment professional with 16 years of extensive experience managing diverse investment portfolios. Do you see interesting opportunities in banks & lenders space? The financial sector has relatively underperformed compared to the broader market, yet recent quarterly results indicate strong earnings growth across most segments, except for public sector banks. Given the sector's strong fundamentals and reasonable valuation levels, there is a distinct possibility of outperformance in the next 12 months. However, slowing credit growth, relatively weak deposit growth, potential asset-liability mismatches, and a likely increase in non-performing assets may temper earnings growth for banks and other financial institutions. Consequently, expecting most of the financial sector may perform in line with the market over the next year. Our outlook is positive on asset management, insurance, and wealth management firms. Is the two-wheeler space looking relatively better compared to commercial and passenger vehicles? Yes, the two-wheeler segment has significantly outperformed the commercial and passenger vehicle sectors in recent months, both in terms of fundamental performance and price appreciation. This trend is expected to continue in the near future, as the two-wheeler segment benefits from favourable demand dynamics and market conditions. Your top bets among sectors and why? Despite a mixed performance across consumption-driven sectors in the April-June 2024 quarter results (Source: NSE) â€”with autos and durables showing growth while FMCG and retail underperformedâ€”remaining positive on consumer-related stocks. In contrast, investment-related sectors such as capital goods, construction, real estate, and cement are fundamentally strong but appear to have built-in high expectations in both earnings and valuations. Additionally, holding a positive view on export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals. Should one keep accumulating pharma space? I have a positive outlook on the healthcare sector. However, given the significant differentiation in business models and product lines within the pharma space, a top-down investment approach is challenging. Do you expect SIP inflow to equity market remain unstoppable? While nothing in life or the stock market is unstoppable, there are compelling reasons to believe that SIP inflows into equity mutual funds in India may continue robustly. First, despite market volatility, SIP inflows have been rising steadily since 2016, indicating that Indian households recognize the value of systematic, long-term equity investment as a wealth creation tool. This growing financial literacy is likely to sustain SIP flows in the coming years. Second, while equity allocations have increased, the proportion of equity-linked instruments in Indian household portfolios remains around 15 percent (Source: RBI), just half the global average. As Indian portfolios align more closely with global norms, expect equity allocations to rise, further boosting SIP inflows. Bank deposits still account for more than double the share of equities in household portfolios. With rising financial awareness, anticipate a continued shift toward equities, which may keep SIP flows strong. ",2024-09-07 06:25

However, going ahead, SpiceJet expects 28 of its aircraft to be ungrounded, doubling its operational fleet capacity.

The S& P 500 dropped 1.7 per cent to close out its worst week since March 2023. Broadcom, Nvidia and other tech companies drove the market lower amid ongoing concerns that their prices soared too high in the boom around artificial intelligence, and they dragged the Nasdaq composite down by a market-leading 2.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 410 points, or 1 per cent, after erasing a morning gain of 250 points. Sharp swings also hit the bond market, where Treasury yields tumbled, recovered and then fell again after the jobs report showed US employers hired fewer workers in August than economists expected. It was billed as the most important jobs report of the year, and it showed a second straight month where hiring came in below forecasts. It also followed recent reports showing weakness in manufacturing and some other areas in the economy. Such a softening of the job market is actually just what the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, have been trying to get in order to stifle high inflation, ""but only to a certain extent and the data is now testing Chair Powell's stated limits,"" said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Friday's data raised questions about how much the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate by at its meeting later this month. The Fed is about to turn its focus more toward protecting the job market and preventing a recession after keeping the federal funds rate at a two-decade high for more than a year. Cuts to interest rates can boost investment prices, but the worry on Wall Street is that the Fed may be moving too late. If a recession does hit, it would undercut corporate profits and erase the benefits from lower rates. ""All is not well with the labour market,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. ""The Fed wanted the labour market to come into better balance, but any balancing act is unstable."" Still, the jobs report did include some encouraging data points. For one, the unemployment rate improved to 4.2 per cent from 4.3 per cent a month earlier. That was better than economists expected. And even if August's hiring was weaker than forecast, it was still better than July's pace. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's board of governors, said in a speech after the jobs report's release that ""I believe we should be data dependent, but not overreact to any data point, including the latest data."" ""While the labour market has clearly cooled, based on the evidence I see, I do not believe the economy is in a recession or necessarily headed for one soon,"" he said. While Waller said he thinks a ""series of reductions"" to rates is appropriate given that a slowing job market now looks like the bigger threat for the economy than high inflation, he said the ultimate pace and depth of those cuts is still to be determined. All the uncertainty sent Treasury yields on a wild ride in the bond market as traders tried to handicap the Fed's next moves. The two-year Treasury yield initially fell as low as 3.64 per cent after the release of the jobs report, before quickly climbing back above 3.76 per cent. It then dropped back to 3.66 per cent following Waller's comments, down from 3.74 per cent late Thursday. Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Wren said he was surprised by the size of markets' swings. While data has clearly shown a slowdown in the economy, he's still forecasting growth to continue, ""and it's not the end of the world"". He cautioned investors against panicking and selling their investments in knee-jerk reactions. Despite its dismal week, the S& P 500 remains just 4.6 per cent below its all-time high set in July. It's also still up 13.4 per cent for 2024 so far, which counts as a good year. A big reason for Friday's sharp drops was weakness for some big tech stocks that had been benefiting from the AI boom. Broadcom tumbled 10.4 per cent despite reporting profit and revenue for the latest quarter that were above analysts' forecasts, thanks in part to AI. The chip company said it expects to make $14 billion in revenue this quarter, which was slightly below analysts' expectations of $14.11 billion, according to FactSet. Its stock sank 15.9 per cent for the week. Other chip companies also fell Friday, including a 4.1 per cent drop for Nvidia. After soaring earlier this year as its revenue surged on the AI frenzy, Nvidia's stock has been shaky since mid-July as investors question whether they took it too high. Because of its massive size, Nvidia's stock is one of the most influential on Wall Street, and it fell 13.9 per cent over the week. That's even though Nvidia has continued to top analysts' expectations for growth. On the winning side of Wall Street was US Steel, which rose 4.3 per cent after the CEO of rival Cleveland Cliffs told MSNBC that his company would still be interested in acquiring US Steel if the White House were to block its proposed sale to Japan's Nippon Steel. All told, the S&P 500 fell 94.99 points to 5,408.42. The Dow dropped 410.34 to 40,345.41, and the Nasdaq composite lost 436.83 to 16,690.83. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Europe and Asia. Trading was halted in Hong Kong because of a typhoon. ",2024-09-07 06:47

Nifty Outlook and Strategy Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research, Angel One Nifty has tested the 20 DEMA and the bullish runaway gap on the daily chart, signifying the strong momentum in the correction. However, it is important to view this profit booking as a healthy component in a predominantly upward trend; this allows for a cooling down of elevated valuations and technical parameters, bringing them to a more comfortable level. On the level-specific front, the 25000 mark now seems to be a critical resistance zone, and an authoritative breakthrough could only bring back the positive momentum in the Nifty.
