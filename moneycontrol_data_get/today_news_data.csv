The European Unionâ€™s Court of Justice upheld a lower courtâ€™s decision, dismissing the companyâ€™s appeal against the 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation blocâ€™s top antitrust enforcer. The commission's original decision in 2017 accused the Silicon Valley giant of unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service to the detriment of competitors. It was one of three multibillion-euro fines that the commission imposed on Google in the previous decade as Brussels started ramping up its crackdown on the tech industry. Google made changes to comply with the commissionâ€™s decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. The company started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. At the same time, the company appealed the decision to the courts. But the EU General Court, the tribunal's lower section, rejected its challenge in 2021 and the Court of Justiceâ€™s adviser later recommended rejecting the appeal. Google is also appealing the other two EU antitrust penalties involving its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising platform. The company was dealt a setback in the Android case when the EU General Court upheld the commission's 4.125 billion euro fine in a 2022 decision. Its initial appeal against a 1.49 billion euro fine in the AdSense case has yet to be decided. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drafted new laws to clean up social media platforms and regulate artificial intelligence. Google is facing particular pressure over its digital advertising business. In a federal antitrust trial set to begin Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges the company holds a monopoly in the â€śad techâ€ť industry. British competition regulators accused Google last week of abusing its dominance in â€śad techâ€ť while the EU is carrying out its own investigation. ",2024-09-10 14:24,2024-09-10,14:24

Spotting them in time and applying emergency brakes have saved hundreds of lives and┬Āaverted┬Ācatastrophic destructions, but the rise in such incidents have become of a cause of serious concern. Only 10 days ago, Farhatullah Ghori, the mastermind of the 2002 Akshardham temple attack and Bengaluru's Rameshwaram Cafe blast, sent a message to terror sleeper cells in India to carry out attacks on trains, petroleum pipelines and Hindu leaders. In the wake of Ghori's call, the threat has become more serious. ""The recent railway accidents have been termed ŌĆśserious in natureŌĆÖ but there is no visible terror angle in recent derailments,"" CNN-News18 quoted its sources from Indian Railways. ŌĆ£Threat to the railways is the biggest but we have managed successfully. After the Farhatullah Ghori threat, we are reporting all incidents of railway accidents and sabotage,ŌĆØ the sources said. Attempts to derail trains point to criminal intent of miscreants, railway ministry officials were quoted in a TOI report. However, no possible terror angle has been established so far. The Railways have seen 7% rise in accidents in the last one year but they are mostly attributed to ""deliberate attempts by people to have fun"". However, four visible cases came into picture where a possible terror angle was involved out of 126 cases, the report said. In the last one week only,┬Āthree┬Āattempts to derail trains and two instances of stone pelting on trains have been recorded: OnSeptember 10, a goods train hit two cement blocks - weighing around 70 kg each - on tracks of the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in the Ajmer district of Rajasthan by putting. OnSeptember 8, Bhiwani-Prayagraj Kalindi Express hit a cooking cylinder kept on the tracks in Kanpur but there was no serious damage as the pilot applied emergency brakes. OnSeptember 5, a major accident was averted as pilot applied brakes in time near Kurduwadi station in Solapur when a fouling mark slab was deliberately placed on the tracks near a signal point. OnAugust 23, Sabarmati-Jodhpur Vande Bharat hit a stone placed on track. Three days before that, a goods train collided with a motorbike rim on the Dedicated Freight Corridor. OnAugust 18, a passenger train hit half a dozen iron rods placed on tracks in Jabalpur. ",2024-09-10 13:30,2024-09-10,13:30

After the conclusion of the 54th GST council meeting on Monday, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the reduced rates will apply prospectively. Here's what got cheaper: Cancer drugs:Rate on cancer drugs namely, Trastuzumab Deruxtecan, Osimertinib and Durvalumab has been reduced from 12 to 5 per cent. Namkeens and savoury food products:The Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on namkeen and savoury food products will be reduced from 18 to 12 per cent. The rate of 5 per cent will continue on unfried or uncooked snack pellets. According to a report by Economic Times, industry experts praised the move. ""With the increasing burden of chronic diseases in India, this is a move toward making life-saving drugs accessible and improving health outcomes,"" Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, told ET. Helicopter travel:The GST Council decided to cut taxes on helicopter services for religious travel to 5 per cent. â€śHelicopter services for religious purposes like Kedarnath, Badrinath have been reduced to 5 from 18 per cent. There was no clarity on this. After this, there will be clarity,"" a report by PTI quoted Uttarakhand Finance Minister Prem Chand Agarwal as saying. Metal scrap:A Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) will be introduced on supply of metal scrap by unregistered person to registered person provided that the supplier shall take registration as and when it crosses threshold limit. The recipient, who is liable to pay under RCM, shall pay tax even if the supplier is under threshold. A TDS of 2% will be applicable on supply of metal scrap by a registered person in B-to-B supply. Car and motorcycle seats:Car seats are classifiable under 9401 and attract a GST rate of 18 per cent at present. The rate on car seats classifiable under 9401 will be increased from 18 to 28 per cent. The uniform rate of 28% will be applicable prospectively for car seats of motor cars to bring parity with seats of motorcycles which already attract a GST rate of 28 percent. Research funds:The Council exempted research funding for higher educational institutions and research centres from GST. This is applicable for universities and research centres that have been established by the law of the state or central government. The decision was taken after the Directorate General of GST Intelligence recently sent show cause notices to seven prominent academic institutions for unpaid taxes on research grants given since 2017. The Council also announced several other decisions, including exempting the import of services by foreign airline companies from related entities abroad, provided the transaction is without consideration. On the cards The decision on the much-anticipated potential reduction in GST on health insurance premium has been deferred. Sitharaman said that there were detailed discussions on the matter. A Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by Biharâ€™s Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary will examine the issue and give its recommendation by the end of October. The GoM on rate rationalisation, which is also headed by Choudhary, will meet on September 23 to finalise the suggestions. The Council has also tasked another GoM to determine the treatment of collections from the compensation cess after its expiry. (With inputs from PIB, agencies) ",2024-09-10 14:02,2024-09-10,14:02

And all of them handsomely outpaced Nifty 50's 26 percent in last one year.Related stories.","Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, and Eicher Motors received the most analyst upgrades in August from a quarter ago, despite recent market volatility, according to Moneycontrol's Analysts' Call Tracker. But the upgrades do not necessarily reflect an overwhelmingly positive mood around auto stocks for two reasons. One, over the past month, the number of upgrades were fewer ‚ÄìTata Motorssaw¬Ý3¬Ýadditional buy call whileBajaj AutoandEicher Motorssaw¬Ý1 each addional buy calls. Secondly, the optimism around Tata Motors and Eichers followed a series of downgrades earlier during the year. Tata Motors now has 23 buys, 7 holds, and 5 sells, up from 20 buys, 8 holds, and 5 sells last quarter. Bajaj Auto shows 22 buys, 10 holds, and 13 sells, compared to 21 buys, 11 holds, and 13 sells previously. Eicher Motors has 17 buys, 12 holds, and 13 sells, up from 16 buys, 11 holds, and 14 sells last quarter.¬ÝA year ago, Tata Motors had 27 buy ratings, 3 hold ratings, and 4 sell ratings, while Eicher Motors had 24 buy ratings, 13 holds, and 6 sells. Overall, after the strong price performance over the past year, analysts are turning somewhat cautious on auto stocks. For the record, the three stocks gained 64 percent, 40 percent and 130 percent, respectively, while the Nifty Auto gained 68 percent. And all of them handsomely outpaced Nifty 50's 26 percent during the period. In FY25, analysts believe such high returns are unlikely to continue. Reasons are clear: vehicle sales, particularly in passenger vehicles (PV) and two-wheelers (2W), are already showing a slowing trend, with declining month-over-month sales since April and decelerating year-on-year growth rates. Factors like high-interest rates, reduced pent-up demand, inflation, and rising vehicle prices are affecting sales. As a result, dealer inventories are rising, discounts are increasing, and a slowdown in wholesale dispatches may follow in the coming quarters, analysts say. Besides, input costs, including steel, rubber, crude, and fuel prices, are also rising, pressuring profitability. Consequently, investors should expect flat or slightly declining operating margins in Q2 FY2025. If these trends persist, earnings growth for auto companies could stall. Some analysts expect a recovery in retail sales in the second half of FY2025, but until then, auto stocks may face a rough patch. Here are some analysts expects on these three automakers: Tata Motors: Analysts expect a soft outlook for JLR over the next two quarters. Despite a favorable product mix, JLR's ASP growth was limited to 0.6% YoY, and variable marketing expenses increased to 3.2% due to weak demand in Europe and concerns in China. Production constraints are expected in Q2/Q3FY25 due to a summer shutdown and supply disruptions. According to InCred Equities, While medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) growth boosted EBITDA by 100 bps in Q1FY25, car demand weakness and delayed EV incentives have led to a 12% cut in the car division‚Äôs EBITDA forecast for FY25F. Despite recent stock gains, high valuations amid business challenges and guidance cuts from global peers lead to a cautious outlook, retaining a ""reduce"" rating, the brokerage house said. Bajaj Auto: Analysts believe Bajaj has a strong position in the Pulsar portfolio and three-wheelers, with positive prospects for its two-wheeler CNG product, although Platina volumes may be affected. The new CNG motorcycle has received a good market response, and the company is expanding its market share in the electric 2W segment. Analysts said more focus is needed in the commuter and premium motorcycle segments (350cc+). Some analysts suggest most near-term positives are already priced into the stock, and the valuation seems high given slower-than-expected export recovery and rising commodity costs. Key domestic volume drivers include continued growth in ICE two-wheelers, two-wheeler CNG, new Pulsar and premium launches, and expansion in electric three-wheelers and two-wheelers. While exports are gradually improving, margins are expected to stay at 20.2% in FY25, rising to 20.7% in FY26. According to InCred Equities, key downside risk is export weakness from geopolitical tensions, while the upside risk is market share gain with the help of captive financing arm and CNG bike. Eicher Motors: Eicher Motors' Royal Enfield (RE) retail volume growth has been muted at 1% in FY25 YTD, compared to 14% growth for the 2W industry, leading to a 50 bps market share loss. Despite new launches, RE's wholesale volume declined by 3%, while the industry's motorcycle wholesale grew by 14%. Elara Securities reduced EPS estimates by 3-4% for FY24-27E due to flat domestic volume growth expected for RE in FY25E. Though margins have been strong, EPS growth is expected to be muted at ~8% YoY during Q2-Q4 FY25E. ‚ÄúWe remain negative due to high prices limiting demand, new model launches cannibalizing sales, the RE-to-RE replacement not materializing, and rising competition. New launches are seen as necessary to maintain, not grow, RE's market share,‚Äù the brokerage said. ",2024-09-10 14:20,2024-09-10,14:20

Though officially announced for a Fall 2025 release, the GTA 6 launch could get pushed to mid-2026, as per the claims of X-verified user Liam @billsyliamgta.

Liam also claims that the GTA VI PC version will be launched 12 to 18 months later than the GTA VI console version. That pushes the claimed GTA VI PC version release to the second half of 2027 or early 2028. But Jason Shrier of Bloomberg thinks otherwise. In a tweet on X, he said: â€śI want to be very clear: Six staff told me they weren't *informed* of a delay.

He said that the government is also focussed on attracting companies such as raw material suppliers, gas suppliers, and other vendors of the semiconductor ecosystem, to India and working to acquire chip fabrication and packaging units. ""We hope that we will also get more investment in this sector. Only fabs will not suffice (or) only OSATs will not suffice. So, we have this inkling that we need to support all the ecosystem components,â€ť he said. Tripathi, who heads the Rs 75,000-crore mission, said there are around 20 additional proposals from semiconductor chip fabrication units, display fabrication companies, raw material suppliers, and chip packaging companies. He said the ISM was considering Tower Semiconductor's proposal to set up a chip fabrication unit and that the government has sought more details from the company. However, a formal proposal by the Tower Semiconductor-Adani Group joint venture has yet to be presented before the ISM. â€śThe ministry (MeitY) has sought details from entities involved in the project. Tower has submitted a proposal but it has to provide detailsâ€¦ and when it provides those details we will examine that. Right now, it is at the appraisal stage and we have sought more information from it,â€ť Tripathi told reported on September 9. Last week, the Maharashtra Cabinet approved a semiconductor fab unit to be set up jointly by the Adani Group and Tower Semiconductor in Panvel, near Mumbai. The unit would entail an investment of about Rs 83,947 crore ($10 billion). He said the government plans to support the industry directly for 10 years, adding that while formulating the ISM, the government had seen double-digit overall fab units in the country. â€śUnder the ISM, we have almost 20 more proposals which include compound semiconductors and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) units among others. Now, we need to look at developing the entire semiconductor ecosystem as only having fabs or OSATs wonâ€™t suffice. Thereâ€™s a need to bring up the entire ecosystem,â€ť he said. â€śUnder the semicon India programme, we had envisioned 2-3 semicon fabs, 2-3 display fabs and also various compound semiconductor fabs. So, I think total numbers will be somewhere around in double digits,â€ť he added. Talking about the revamping plans of the government's Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL) in Mohali, Tripathi said that big private players have been keen on the project, and a request for proposal (RFP) on it will be floated very soon. India will host the first global semiconductor industry event, Semicon India 2024, from September 11 to 13. ICEA chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said that the mobile phone industry in India will consume the storage chips that will be made in India. ",2024-09-10 13:23,2024-09-10,13:23

What's the way out?","When the regulator follows up with the registered entity, the RA or RIA may not even have been aware that such a fraud has been committed..Related stories.","Research analysts and investment advisors registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) are now having to deal with fake profiles and imposters who are cheating investors by pretending to beâ€”andÂ then placing the legal and thus the financial burden onâ€”these registered entities. Legal experts told Moneycontrol that such cases are on the rise. When investors are defrauded, they raise their complaints throughÂ SEBI'sÂ online redressal system, SCORES. This involves the investor choosing the registered entity's name and then giving the details of the fraud committed. Also read:ÂSebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch continued to earn from Agora, provided advisory services to M&M, Dr Reddy's: Congress The regulator then follows this up with the registered entity. InÂ these cases of impersonation, the research analyst (RA) or registered investment advisor (RIA) in question is usually and not surprisingly not even aware of such an act beingÂ committed. Moneycontrol spoke to a few legal experts to understand what registered entities can do to protect themselves in such cases. File complaints, post alertsAnand Kankani, a practising company secretary and who advises RAs and RIAs, said that an intermediary should immediately lodge a complaint with the cybercrime portal,Â notify SEBI and BSE Administration and Supervision Ltd (BASL), and inform all its clients about the same. To inform clients, the intermediary can run a message on its website (if it has one) and also post on all its social media pages, such as on Twitter, Instagram and so on, ""where they (the intermediaries) usually post matters pertaining to securities market"" and through the social-media handles that RIAs are required to declare with SEBI. Kankani emphasised that this is a crucial step for investor protection and for safeguarding the intermediary from regulatory action. The market regulator usually relies on the fact whether the intermediary registered a police complaint in the form of a first information report (FIR), said Kankani, and added that it is, therefore, advisable to lodge an FIR. However, he agreed that if there are multiple such attempts to impersonate an intermediary, then it may not be practical to file an FIR for every attempt. Some ofÂ RAS and RIAs have even reported multiple instances of such impersonations in a day. Vinod Joseph, partner at Economic Laws Practice, suggested that when the frequency is high, an intermediary can taper out the number of FIRs filed. That is, file for a certain number of them in the beginning and keep filing the complaints in fewer numbers as the frequency of fraud increases. This will show the regulator that there was an intent to correct this fraud. However, an FIR should be filed in every instance where the fraud appears to be substantial. Is there collusion? Joseph said that the regulator takes such stringent measures because there may be instances where the intermediary colluded with a third party to commit fraud. That is, the intermediary may allow a third party to use his/her name and take payment, and then the intermediary may be given a share of this payment. ""How would the regulator know if the intermediary was not acting in collusion with the overt perpetrators?"" asked Joseph, whoÂ hence suggested the intermediary at least get FIRs filed for the first few instances. If an FIR is not possible, then the intermediary can register a complaint through a magistrate. Kankani pointed out that the regulator has tried to separate the wheat from the chaff by proposing a separate portal through which investors can make their payment to the registered intermediaries. ""This will help investors differentiate registered entities from unregistered entities who pretend to be registered,"" he said. Also read:ÂMadhabi Puri Buch's IIM-Ahmedabad batchmates call allegations against her 'false' He added that the regulator could also set up a platform in association with theÂ Cyber Crime Portal, where investors and intermediaries can report fake social media handles and channels. Red flags Kankani also asked investors to look out for two red flags that should alert them to bad actorsâ€”one, they will ask the client to pay money in a bank account that does not belong to the intermediary; and two, they will promise assured returns that are often high and for a disproportionately small fee.

The stock¬†fell out of favour with some¬† brokerages as 'buy' calls for Apollo reduced to 23 in August, down from 25 a month ago. Meanwhile, 'hold' and 'sell' ratings¬†ticked up one each¬†to three, and¬†two, respectively, hinting at a cooldown in expectations of a strong upside. Here's a catch It's important to note that the downgrades from brokerages were largely driven by concerns over the stock's high valuations, rather than serious worries about its growth potential. Take Elara Capital, for example. The brokerage downgradedApollo Hospitalsto a 'reduce' rating last month, citing limited upside potential from current levels. Interestingly, despite the downgrade, Elara raised its price target by over 4 percent to Rs 6,457, reflecting a cautious yet optimistic outlook. The stock has run-up 35 percent in the past year. The stock has been on an uptrend in the past year despite struggling with weak margins on account of losses from its digital arms Apollo 24/7 and Apollo HealthCo. Even with several positive catalysts now in play‚ÄĒsuch as reduced 24/7 losses, guidance for a 100 bps improvement in hospital margins, and Apollo HealthCo¬†staying EBITDA positive for the third quarter in a row‚ÄĒanalysts who downgraded the stock believe these factors were already priced into Apollo's valuation much earlier. Nomura was another brokerage that downgraded Apollo Hospitals to a 'neutral' call in the past month. ""We think the current valuation multiples factor in the improved profitability of the hospital business, and rising demand of premium healthcare,"" the brokerage wrote. Some margin contraction in FY26 In a bid to expand its margin for the flagship hospital business, Apollo has postponed its greenfield bed expansion from Q4FY25 to H1FY26, a move that ICICI Securities believes could boost FY25 EBITDA for the hospitals segment by 100-150 basis points. However, the delay may negatively affect FY26 margins, as new beds typically take 1-2 years to reach breakeven. Also Read |¬†Analyst Call Tracker Sept 2024: Why downgrades have pile up for Tata Steel, Titan, Tata Motors over the past year Nomura also reiterated the view and believes that the greenfield sites to be commissioned starting FY26 will be a drag on EBITDA margin. The brokerage factors in¬†EBITDA losses of¬†Rs 160 crore and Rs 60 crore in FY26 and FY27, respectively, on account of new facilities. Additionally, Nomura has flagged potential risks associated with new sites, especially in cities where there is no existing presence. The brokerage has also chosen not to further increase the valuation multiple for the hospital business due to its high capital intensity, the risks tied to new expansions, and the strong bargaining power of doctors. Growth outlook intact Despite these near-term hiccups, the¬†growth outlook for Apollo Hospitals stays largely intact. The company's management is focused on enhancing the operating margins of its flagship business by improving the surgical and payor mix in its hospitals while also reducing operating costs at Apollo 24/7 over the past few quarters. As for the near future, the company plans a 4 percent hike in hospital tariffs¬†on account of medical inflation combined with an expected 7¬†percent¬†spike in overall ARPOB for FY25. Additionally, occupancy rates are expected to climb beyond 70 percent in the coming quarters-¬†a target it set but fell short of in FY24. Meanwhile, the¬† merger of Apollo HealthCo with pharmacy¬†distributor Keimed is also referred to¬† as a¬†step in the right direction¬†by several experts. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities highlight that the integration of Keimed into¬†Apollo Hospitals¬†has been a longstanding investor ask due to its¬†synergy benefits, particularly the opportunity to push Apollo Hospitals‚Äô Rs 1,500 crore private label business through Keimed‚Äôs extensive 70,000+ pharmacy network.

The act aims to prohibit US drugmakers from engaging in business with five Chinese companies after eight years. The bill seeks to reduce the US biopharmaceutical industry's reliance on China and limit technology transfers to the country. It specifically targets five Chinese companiesâ€”WuXi Apptec, Wuxi Biologics, BGI, MGI, and Complete Genomics. As per the act, companies that engage in collaborations with these entities will be ineligible for grants, loans, and contracts from executive agencies. With up to 120 US biopharmaceutical drugs being under the scanner of this bill, attention has now shifted to Indian pharma companies, which are anticipated to be the major beneficiaries of its passage. Contract development manufacturing players like Divi's Labs, Laurus Labs, Neuland Laboratories, Syngene, Suven Pharma, and Piramal Pharma are likely to witness a spike in work coming their way as US companies shift manufacturing bases away from China. Brokerage firm InCred Equities highlighted that the CDMO market has been growing at a faster pace than the global pharmaceutical market. A lot of this growth is driven by emerging biotech and biopharmaceutical companies that do not have the capital to invest in setting up manufacturing plants. ""As a result, rival companies located in India, Japan, Europe, and America will benefit the most from the Biosecure Act,"" the brokerage stated. The brokerage further noted that the shift has already started happening on the ground, as several companies like Beigene and Eli Lilly have started looking for other CDMO partners. Meanwhile, the management of Indian CROs and CDMOs has also stated that they are seeing an increase in inquiries after the introduction of the bill. The managements of Laurus Labs, Neuland Labs, Piramal Pharma, and Syngene, in interactions with CNBC-TV18, stated they have witnessed an increase in order queries. Buoyed by their improved growth prospects,shares of Laurus Labs, Piramal Pharma, and Syngene surged 3-4 percent. Laurus Labs anticipates that the shift towards Indian pharma companies will be gradual, starting with smaller projects. Piramal Pharma is seeing increased exploratory discussions and customer inquiries, but no major decisions have been made yet. Neuland Labs is engaging in more talks and meetings with US firms but hasn't yet experienced a significant uptick in proposals or orders. Although optimistic about medium to long-term prospects, Neuland's focus on APIs rather than clinical or biologically focused CDMOs distinguishes its position. Syngene, on the other hand, is gaining momentum due to its existing long-term contracts and has observed a 'material shift' in Big Pharma's sourcing strategies. Syngene is actively involved in pilot projects related to the 'China Switch' and reported a 50 percent on-yearÂ riseÂ in RFP (requests for proposals) value in the first quarter, marking its best performance in four years. China's loss, India's gain China's loss of market share due to US trade sanctions and Covid-19 disruptions has created a significant opportunity for Indiaâ€™s CDMO sector. InCred Equities attributes this shift as a major driver of India's CDMO growth, forecasting the market to expand from $19.63 billion in 2023 to $44.69 billion by 2029, at a nearly 15 percent CAGR. The brokerage also highlights government incentives like the PLI scheme, increased FDI, and private equity as other growth drivers for the industry. Additionally, rising capex is set to boost capacity and skills, while cost competitiveness and a strong regulatory track record will support the growth of domestic CDMO players.

In a filing to the stock exchange, theÂ Mahindra Group saidÂ that the compensation made to DhavalÂ Buch were made for his supply chain expertise and management acumen, basedon his global experience at Unilever. ""We categorically state that we have not, at any point, requested SEBI for any preferential treatment,""Â the statement said,Â calling theÂ allegations 'false and misleading in nature', without naming any political party. Earlier in the day, Congress had madefresh allegations, claiming that MadhabiÂ and husband Dhaval Buch had continued to earn from the advisory firm.Â Congress leader Pawan Khera in his statement had mentioned about Agora Advisory - a company held by Sebi chairperson Madhabi and her husband - which was claimed as dormant, but received funds from Mahindra and Mahindra between 2019-21, while she was a whole-time member of SEBI. Congress alleged that in this period, there were favourable orders issued to M&M. ""During this period, SEBI had also issued several orders in favour of Mahindra & Mahindra,"" a charge that has been denied by the business group. ""None of the 5 SEBI orders or approvals referenced in the allegations are relevant,"" said Mahindra Group's statement. Mahindra Group clarified thatÂ out of the five orders, three did not pertain to the company or any of its subsidiary. One of the approvals was for aÂ fast-track rights issue, which did not require any approval from SEBI, and another one pertained to an order issued in 2018, before Dhaval started working with the Mahindra Group. Mahindra Group said Dhaval Buch was hired in 2019 for his expertise in supply chain and sourcing, after he retired as Unilever's Global Chief Procurement Officer. Most part of his stint at Mahindra Group was at Bristlecone, a supply chain consulting subsidiary, where Dhaval Buch is currently on the Board of the company. Mr Buch had joined Mahindra Group almost three years before Madhabi Puri Buch was appointed as SEBI Chairperson, the statement by Mahindra Group added. ",2024-09-10 14:25,2024-09-10,14:25

What's the way out?","When the regulator follows up with the registered entity, the RA or RIA may not even have been aware that such a fraud has been committed..Related stories.","Research analysts and investment advisors registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) are now having to deal with fake profiles and imposters who are cheating investors by pretending to beâ€”andÂ then placing the legal and thus the financial burden onâ€”these registered entities. Legal experts told Moneycontrol that such cases are on the rise. When investors are defrauded, they raise their complaints throughÂ SEBI'sÂ online redressal system, SCORES. This involves the investor choosing the registered entity's name and then giving the details of the fraud committed. Also read:ÂSebi chief Madhabi Puri Buch continued to earn from Agora, provided advisory services to M&M, Dr Reddy's: Congress The regulator then follows this up with the registered entity. InÂ these cases of impersonation, the research analyst (RA) or registered investment advisor (RIA) in question is usually and not surprisingly not even aware of such an act beingÂ committed. Moneycontrol spoke to a few legal experts to understand what registered entities can do to protect themselves in such cases. File complaints, post alertsAnand Kankani, a practising company secretary and who advises RAs and RIAs, said that an intermediary should immediately lodge a complaint with the cybercrime portal,Â notify SEBI and BSE Administration and Supervision Ltd (BASL), and inform all its clients about the same. To inform clients, the intermediary can run a message on its website (if it has one) and also post on all its social media pages, such as on Twitter, Instagram and so on, ""where they (the intermediaries) usually post matters pertaining to securities market"" and through the social-media handles that RIAs are required to declare with SEBI. Kankani emphasised that this is a crucial step for investor protection and for safeguarding the intermediary from regulatory action. The market regulator usually relies on the fact whether the intermediary registered a police complaint in the form of a first information report (FIR), said Kankani, and added that it is, therefore, advisable to lodge an FIR. However, he agreed that if there are multiple such attempts to impersonate an intermediary, then it may not be practical to file an FIR for every attempt. Some ofÂ RAS and RIAs have even reported multiple instances of such impersonations in a day. Vinod Joseph, partner at Economic Laws Practice, suggested that when the frequency is high, an intermediary can taper out the number of FIRs filed. That is, file for a certain number of them in the beginning and keep filing the complaints in fewer numbers as the frequency of fraud increases. This will show the regulator that there was an intent to correct this fraud. However, an FIR should be filed in every instance where the fraud appears to be substantial. Is there collusion? Joseph said that the regulator takes such stringent measures because there may be instances where the intermediary colluded with a third party to commit fraud. That is, the intermediary may allow a third party to use his/her name and take payment, and then the intermediary may be given a share of this payment. ""How would the regulator know if the intermediary was not acting in collusion with the overt perpetrators?"" asked Joseph, whoÂ hence suggested the intermediary at least get FIRs filed for the first few instances. If an FIR is not possible, then the intermediary can register a complaint through a magistrate. Kankani pointed out that the regulator has tried to separate the wheat from the chaff by proposing a separate portal through which investors can make their payment to the registered intermediaries. ""This will help investors differentiate registered entities from unregistered entities who pretend to be registered,"" he said. Also read:ÂMadhabi Puri Buch's IIM-Ahmedabad batchmates call allegations against her 'false' He added that the regulator could also set up a platform in association with theÂ Cyber Crime Portal, where investors and intermediaries can report fake social media handles and channels. Red flags Kankani also asked investors to look out for two red flags that should alert them to bad actorsâ€”one, they will ask the client to pay money in a bank account that does not belong to the intermediary; and two, they will promise assured returns that are often high and for a disproportionately small fee.

The stock¬†fell out of favour with some¬† brokerages as 'buy' calls for Apollo reduced to 23 in August, down from 25 a month ago. Meanwhile, 'hold' and 'sell' ratings¬†ticked up one each¬†to three, and¬†two, respectively, hinting at a cooldown in expectations of a strong upside. Here's a catch It's important to note that the downgrades from brokerages were largely driven by concerns over the stock's high valuations, rather than serious worries about its growth potential. Take Elara Capital, for example. The brokerage downgradedApollo Hospitalsto a 'reduce' rating last month, citing limited upside potential from current levels. Interestingly, despite the downgrade, Elara raised its price target by over 4 percent to Rs 6,457, reflecting a cautious yet optimistic outlook. The stock has run-up 35 percent in the past year. The stock has been on an uptrend in the past year despite struggling with weak margins on account of losses from its digital arms Apollo 24/7 and Apollo HealthCo. Even with several positive catalysts now in play‚ÄĒsuch as reduced 24/7 losses, guidance for a 100 bps improvement in hospital margins, and Apollo HealthCo¬†staying EBITDA positive for the third quarter in a row‚ÄĒanalysts who downgraded the stock believe these factors were already priced into Apollo's valuation much earlier. Nomura was another brokerage that downgraded Apollo Hospitals to a 'neutral' call in the past month. ""We think the current valuation multiples factor in the improved profitability of the hospital business, and rising demand of premium healthcare,"" the brokerage wrote. Some margin contraction in FY26 In a bid to expand its margin for the flagship hospital business, Apollo has postponed its greenfield bed expansion from Q4FY25 to H1FY26, a move that ICICI Securities believes could boost FY25 EBITDA for the hospitals segment by 100-150 basis points. However, the delay may negatively affect FY26 margins, as new beds typically take 1-2 years to reach breakeven. Also Read |¬†Analyst Call Tracker Sept 2024: Why downgrades have pile up for Tata Steel, Titan, Tata Motors over the past year Nomura also reiterated the view and believes that the greenfield sites to be commissioned starting FY26 will be a drag on EBITDA margin. The brokerage factors in¬†EBITDA losses of¬†Rs 160 crore and Rs 60 crore in FY26 and FY27, respectively, on account of new facilities. Additionally, Nomura has flagged potential risks associated with new sites, especially in cities where there is no existing presence. The brokerage has also chosen not to further increase the valuation multiple for the hospital business due to its high capital intensity, the risks tied to new expansions, and the strong bargaining power of doctors. Growth outlook intact Despite these near-term hiccups, the¬†growth outlook for Apollo Hospitals stays largely intact. The company's management is focused on enhancing the operating margins of its flagship business by improving the surgical and payor mix in its hospitals while also reducing operating costs at Apollo 24/7 over the past few quarters. As for the near future, the company plans a 4 percent hike in hospital tariffs¬†on account of medical inflation combined with an expected 7¬†percent¬†spike in overall ARPOB for FY25. Additionally, occupancy rates are expected to climb beyond 70 percent in the coming quarters-¬†a target it set but fell short of in FY24. Meanwhile, the¬† merger of Apollo HealthCo with pharmacy¬†distributor Keimed is also referred to¬† as a¬†step in the right direction¬†by several experts. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities highlight that the integration of Keimed into¬†Apollo Hospitals¬†has been a longstanding investor ask due to its¬†synergy benefits, particularly the opportunity to push Apollo Hospitals‚Äô Rs 1,500 crore private label business through Keimed‚Äôs extensive 70,000+ pharmacy network. The merger is also expected to significantly reduce Apollo Pharmacy‚Äôs related party transactions by approximately 93 percent, creating a more integrated and efficient distribution franchise.

Namkeens and savoury food products:The Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on namkeen and savoury food products will be reduced from 18 to 12 per cent. The rate of 5 per cent will continue on unfried or uncooked snack pellets. According to a report by Economic Times, industry experts praised the move. ""With the increasing burden of chronic diseases in India, this is a move toward making life-saving drugs accessible and improving health outcomes,"" Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, told ET. Helicopter travel:The GST Council decided to cut taxes on helicopter services for religious travel to 5 per cent. â€śHelicopter services for religious purposes like Kedarnath, Badrinath have been reduced to 5 from 18 per cent. There was no clarity on this. After this, there will be clarity,"" a report by PTI quoted Uttarakhand Finance Minister Prem Chand Agarwal as saying. Metal scrap:A Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) will be introduced on supply of metal scrap by unregistered person to registered person provided that the supplier shall take registration as and when it crosses threshold limit.

Research funds:The Council exempted research funding for higher educational institutions and research centres from GST. This is applicable for universities and research centres that have been established by the law of the state or central government. The decision was taken after the Directorate General of GST Intelligence recently sent show cause notices to seven prominent academic institutions for unpaid taxes on research grants given since 2017. The Council also announced several other decisions, including exempting the import of services by foreign airline companies from related entities abroad, provided the transaction is without consideration. On the cards The decision on the much-anticipated potential reduction in GST on health insurance premium has been deferred. Sitharaman said that there were detailed discussions on the matter. A Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by Biharâ€™s Deputy Chief Minister Samrat Choudhary will examine the issue and give its recommendation by the end of October. The GoM on rate rationalisation, which is also headed by Choudhary, will meet on September 23 to finalise the suggestions. The Council has also tasked another GoM to determine the treatment of collections from the compensation cess after its expiry. (With inputs from PIB, agencies) ",2024-09-10 14:02,2024-09-10,14:02

A total of 2 crore shares of the company changed hands on BSE and NSE combined so far, compared to the one-week average trading volume of 1 crore shares. Inox Wind is an integrated wind energy solutions provider. The company is engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of wind turbine generators (WTGs). It also provides erection, procurement and commissioning (EPC), operations and maintenance (O&M) and common infrastructure facilities services for WTGs and wind farm development services.

The act aims to prohibit US drugmakers from engaging in business with five Chinese companies after eight years. The bill seeks to reduce the US biopharmaceutical industry's reliance on China and limit technology transfers to the country. It specifically targets five Chinese companiesâ€”WuXi Apptec, Wuxi Biologics, BGI, MGI, and Complete Genomics. As per the act, companies that engage in collaborations with these entities will be ineligible for grants, loans, and contracts from executive agencies. With up to 120 US biopharmaceutical drugs being under the scanner of this bill, attention has now shifted to Indian pharma companies, which are anticipated to be the major beneficiaries of its passage. Contract development manufacturing players like Divi's Labs, Laurus Labs, Neuland Laboratories, Syngene, Suven Pharma, and Piramal Pharma are likely to witness a spike in work coming their way as US companies shift manufacturing bases away from China. Brokerage firm InCred Equities highlighted that the CDMO market has been growing at a faster pace than the global pharmaceutical market. A lot of this growth is driven by emerging biotech and biopharmaceutical companies that do not have the capital to invest in setting up manufacturing plants. ""As a result, rival companies located in India, Japan, Europe, and America will benefit the most from the Biosecure Act,"" the brokerage stated. The brokerage further noted that the shift has already started happening on the ground, as several companies like Beigene and Eli Lilly have started looking for other CDMO partners. Meanwhile, the management of Indian CROs and CDMOs has also stated that they are seeing an increase in inquiries after the introduction of the bill. The managements of Laurus Labs, Neuland Labs, Piramal Pharma, and Syngene, in interactions with CNBC-TV18, stated they have witnessed an increase in order queries. Buoyed by their improved growth prospects,shares of Laurus Labs, Piramal Pharma, and Syngene surged 3-4 percent. Laurus Labs anticipates that the shift towards Indian pharma companies will be gradual, starting with smaller projects. Piramal Pharma is seeing increased exploratory discussions and customer inquiries, but no major decisions have been made yet. Neuland Labs is engaging in more talks and meetings with US firms but hasn't yet experienced a significant uptick in proposals or orders. Although optimistic about medium to long-term prospects, Neuland's focus on APIs rather than clinical or biologically focused CDMOs distinguishes its position. Syngene, on the other hand, is gaining momentum due to its existing long-term contracts and has observed a 'material shift' in Big Pharma's sourcing strategies. Syngene is actively involved in pilot projects related to the 'China Switch' and reported a 50 percent on-yearÂ riseÂ in RFP (requests for proposals) value in the first quarter, marking its best performance in four years. China's loss, India's gain China's loss of market share due to US trade sanctions and Covid-19 disruptions has created a significant opportunity for Indiaâ€™s CDMO sector. InCred Equities attributes this shift as a major driver of India's CDMO growth, forecasting the market to expand from $19.63 billion in 2023 to $44.69 billion by 2029, at a nearly 15 percent CAGR. The brokerage also highlights government incentives like the PLI scheme, increased FDI, and private equity as other growth drivers for the industry. Additionally, rising capex is set to boost capacity and skills, while cost competitiveness and a strong regulatory track record will support the growth of domestic CDMO players.

They added that the company is contemplating an initial public offering (IPO), and is likely to go public in FY26. â€śWe started our journey 10 years ago, with an initial capacity of 200 megawatts (MW). Since then, weâ€™ve experienced consistent growth. Our revenue has increased ten-foldâ€”from Rs 100 crore to over Rs 1,100 crore last yearâ€”placing us among the fastest-growing solar companies. We now operate three manufacturing facilities, and as part of our long-term strategy, we are focused on both forward and backward integration. We are continuously expanding our customer base and strengthening our market position,â€ť said Prashant Mathur, CEO of Saatvik Solar. Mathur added that as part of its expansion plan, the company is adding 2 GW of cell manufacturing and an additional 4 GW of module manufacturing. â€śWe will initially add 2 GW of cell manufacturing and 2 GW of module production, with the potential to expand module production by another 2 GW. By next year, weÂ plan to have a total capacity of 5.86 GW for modules and 2 GW for cells,â€ť he said. 'See revenue increasing to Rs 2,000 cr' With the additional capacity, the company expects its revenue to increase to Rs 1,800-2,000 crore this financial year and it is aiming to grow its top line in high double digits in the coming years. Saatvik will invest around Rs 1,500 crore for this capex plan, the funding for which will come from internal accruals and debt. â€śWe have a strong relationship with a few bankers and they are ready to finance us. We would then generate a lot of internal accruals and this will be sufficient to fund our equity portion. Some large power finance companies have shown interest in funding the project, and we are in talks with them,â€ť said Abani Jha, CFO of Saatvik Solar. IPO plan While theÂ  current capexÂ requirement are going to be metÂ fromÂ internal accruals and debt, the company is likely to soon follow in the footsteps of its counterpartsPremier Energies, Waaree Energies and Vikram Solar, which have already debuted on the stock markets or have announcedÂ  intentions to do so. â€śWe are thinking but we are at a very early stage of our thought process and nothing has materialised as yet. Sooner or later, one company has to travel in that direction, but we areÂ at a very early phase of that thought, as of now,â€ť said Jha, adding that a public market debut is unlikely this fiscal and the company may look at FY26 for going public Also Read:ÂIndian solar panel makers plan to raise Rs 5,800 crore this year Not much focus on exports right now The company is currently focused on supplying to the domestic market and exports form only a small part ofÂ theÂ business. Exports will continue to remain a smaller focus area in the near future, given the dumping of Chinese solar modules in the global market, the management said. ""While exports are part of our focus, they are not a primary priority. However, due to the current unattractive prices in North America, driven down by Chinese dumping, we are not prioritising this market at present,â€ť said Mathur. â€śWith the added cell capacity, we will shift some of our attention to North America. Despite this, we believe the Indian market is currently very strong and will remain our main focus. Our target is to generate about 10-15Â percent of our revenues from North America as the market becomes more favourable. With an existing customer base in place, we are well-positioned to expand our presence in the region when the situation improves,â€ť he added. Saatvik also has plans to set up a 1 GW module manufacturing facility in the US, but has currently kept those plans on hold due to the upcoming presidential elections. Apart from the expansion into solar cell manufacturing, the comoany is looking at further backward integration and expanding into newer areas, such as green hydrogen. â€śApart from module and cell manufacturing and potentially wafers and ingots in future, we are also looking at electrolysers and green hydrogen and battery manufacturing. TheyÂ are the new technologies which are going to be a good mix with solar, and will further drive the organisationâ€™s growth,â€ť said Mathur. ",2024-09-10 13:55,2024-09-10,13:55

He said that the government is also focussed on attracting companies such as raw material suppliers, gas suppliers, and other vendors of the semiconductor ecosystem, to India and working to acquire chip fabrication and packaging units. ""We hope that we will also get more investment in this sector. Only fabs will not suffice (or) only OSATs will not suffice. So, we have this inkling that we need to support all the ecosystem components,â€ť he said. Tripathi, who heads the Rs 75,000-crore mission, said there are around 20 additional proposals from semiconductor chip fabrication units, display fabrication companies, raw material suppliers, and chip packaging companies. He said the ISM was considering Tower Semiconductor's proposal to set up a chip fabrication unit and that the government has sought more details from the company. However, a formal proposal by the Tower Semiconductor-Adani Group joint venture has yet to be presented before the ISM. â€śThe ministry (MeitY) has sought details from entities involved in the project. Tower has submitted a proposal but it has to provide detailsâ€¦ and when it provides those details we will examine that. Right now, it is at the appraisal stage and we have sought more information from it,â€ť Tripathi told reported on September 9. Last week, the Maharashtra Cabinet approved a semiconductor fab unit to be set up jointly by the Adani Group and Tower Semiconductor in Panvel, near Mumbai. The unit would entail an investment of about Rs 83,947 crore ($10 billion). He said the government plans to support the industry directly for 10 years, adding that while formulating the ISM, the government had seen double-digit overall fab units in the country. â€śUnder the ISM, we have almost 20 more proposals which include compound semiconductors and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) units among others.
