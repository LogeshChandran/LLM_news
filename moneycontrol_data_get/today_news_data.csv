The event, at 9 p.m. Eastern in Philadelphia, will offer Americans their most detailed look at a campaign thatŌĆÖs dramatically changed since the last debate in June. In rapid fashion, President Joe Biden bowed out of the race after his disastrous performance, Trump survived an assassination attempt and bothsides chose their running mates. Harris is intent on demonstrating that she can press the Democratic case against Trump better than Biden did. Trump, in turn, is trying to paint the vice president as an out-of-touch liberal while trying to win over voters skeptical he should return to the White House. Trump, 78, has struggled to adapt to Harris, 59, who is the first woman, Black person and person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. The Republican former president has at times resorted to invoking racial and gender stereotypes, frustrating allies who want Trump to focus instead on policy differences with Harris. The vice president, for her part, will try to claim a share of credit for the Biden administrationŌĆÖs accomplishments while also addressing its low moments and explaining her shifts away from more liberal positions she took in the past. The debate will subject Harris, who has sat for only a single formal interview in the past six weeks, to a rare moment of sustained questioning. ŌĆ£If she performs great, itŌĆÖs going to be a nice surprise for the Democrats and theyŌĆÖll rejoice,"" said Ari Fleischer, a Republican communications strategist and former press secretary to President George W. Bush. ""If she flops, like Joe Biden did, it could break this race wide open. So thereŌĆÖs more riding on it.ŌĆØ Tim Hogan, who led Sen. Amy KlobucharŌĆÖs debate preparations in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, said Harris, a former California attorney general, would bring a ŌĆ£prosecutor's instincts to the debate stage.ŌĆØ ŌĆ£That is a very strong quality in that setting: having someone who knows how to land a punch and how to translate it,"" Hogan said. The first early ballots of the presidential race will go out just hours after the debate, hosted by ABC News. Absentee ballots are set to be sent out beginning Wednesday in Alabama. Trump and his campaignhave spotlighted far-left positions she took during her failed 2020 presidential bid. HeŌĆÖs been assisted in his informal debate prep sessions by Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who tore into Harris during their primary debates. Harris has sought to defend her shifts away from liberal causes to more moderate stances on fracking, expanding Medicare for all and mandatory gun buyback programs ŌĆö and even backing away from her position that plastic straws should be banned ŌĆö as pragmatism, insisting that her ŌĆ£values remain the same.ŌĆØ Her campaign on Monday published a page on its website listing her positions on key issues. The former president has argued aHarrispresidency is a threat to the safety of the country, highlighting that Biden tapped her to address the influx of migrants as the Republican once again makes dark warnings about immigration and those in the country illegally central to his campaign. He has sought to portray a Harris presidency as the continuation of BidenŌĆÖs still-unpopular administration, particularly his economic record, as voters still feel the bite of inflation even as it has cooled in recent months. TrumpŌĆÖs team insist his tone wonŌĆÖt be any different facing a female opponent. ŌĆ£President Trump is going to be himself,ŌĆØ senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters during a phone call Monday. Gabbard, who was also on the call, added that Trump ŌĆ£respects women and doesnŌĆÖt feel the need to be patronizing or to speak to women in any other way than he would speak to a man.ŌĆØ His advisers suggest Harris has a tendency to express herself in a ŌĆ£word saladŌĆØ of meaningless phrases, prompting Trump to say last week that his debate strategy was to ŌĆ£let her talk.ŌĆØ The former president frequently plows into rambling remarks that detour from his policy points. He regularly makes false claims about the last election, attacks a lengthy list of enemies and opponents working against him, offers praise for foreign strongmen and comments about race, like his false claim in July that Harris recently ŌĆ£happened to turn Black.ŌĆØ The vice president, who has been the Biden administrationŌĆÖs most outspoken supporter of abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, is expected to focus on calling out TrumpŌĆÖs inconsistencies around womenŌĆÖs reproductive care, including his announcement that he will vote to protect FloridaŌĆÖs six-week abortion ban in a statewide referendum this fall. Harris was also set to try to portray herself as a steadier hand to lead the nation and safeguard its alliances, as war rages in Ukraine more than two years after RussiaŌĆÖs invasion and IsraelŌĆÖs war with Hamas in Gaza drags on with no end in sight. She is likely to warn that Trump presents a threat to democracy, from his attempts in 2020 to overturn his loss in the presidential election, spurring his angry supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, through comments he made as recently as last weekend. Trump on social media issued yet another message of retribution, threatening that if he wins he will jail ŌĆ£those involved in unscrupulous behavior,ŌĆØ including lawyers, political operatives, donors, voters and election officials. Harris has spent the better part of the last five days ensconced in debate preparations in Pennsylvania, where she participated in hours-long mock sessions with a Trump stand-in. Ahead of the debate, she told radio host Rickey Smiley that she was workshopping how to respond if Trump lies. ŌĆ£ThereŌĆÖs no floor for him in terms of how low he will go,ŌĆØ she said.

In the town of Ramenskoye just outside Moscow, drones hit two multistory residential buildings and started fires, Moscow region Gov. Andrei Vorobyov said. A woman was killed and three more people sustained injuries. Five residential buildings near one of those damaged have been evacuated as emergency services were handling drone debris, Vorobyov said. The attack also prompted the authorities to temporarily shut down three airports just outside Moscow â€” Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky. A total of 48 flights were diverted to other airports, according to Russiaâ€™s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia. In Moscow, drone debris fell on a private house on the outskirts of the city, but no one was hurt, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. He counted over a dozen drones heading toward Moscow that were shot down by air defenses as they were approaching the city. Overall, Russiaâ€™s Defense Ministry said it â€śintercepted and destroyedâ€ť 144 Ukrainian drones over nine Russian regions, including those on the border with Ukraine and those deeper inside Russia. It is the second massive Ukrainian drone attack on Russia this month. On Sept. 1, the Russian military said it intercepted 158 Ukrainian drones over a dozen Russian regions in what Russian media described as the biggest Ukrainian drone barrage since the start of the war.

The father of the modern oil industry had a name for it: a ŌĆ£good sweating.ŌĆØ A century later, OPEC+ is giving Big Oil the modern equivalent of RockefellerŌĆÖs time-tested tactics. Not everyone will be fit enough for it. For the last two-and-a-half years, Big Oil has enjoyed a bonanza, profiting from the impact of RussiaŌĆÖs invasion of Ukraine and OPEC+ŌĆÖs tight control of the market. High prices inflated cash generation, leading to bumper payouts to shareholders ŌĆö┬Āvia, above all, buybacks. But the tailwind has now turned into a headwind, and the size of the groupŌĆÖs share repurchases will drop, probably from 2025 onward. Jefferies Financial Group Inc, an investment bank, has warned that at current forward prices for next year, half of the international oil companies ŌĆ£canŌĆÖt sustain their distributionŌĆØ without taking more debt. For Big Oil, thatŌĆÖs a big problem. The industry┬ĀdoesnŌĆÖt have many allies on┬ĀWall Street┬Āand certainly even fewer in the greener financial hubs of Europe. In the climate-crisis era, Fossil Fuel Inc needs to shower shareholders with money just to keep investors ŌĆö particularly the large generalists ŌĆö onside.  The size of the buybacks has been huge. Only this quarter, ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Shell Plc, TotalEnergies SE┬Āand BP Plc┬Āplan to repurchase more than $16.5 billion┬Āof shares. On an annualised basis, thatŌĆÖs equal to $66 billion a year, or about 5.5% of Big OilŌĆÖs current combined market value. The mega buybacks made sense during the boom. But Big Oil now faces┬Āa completely different┬Ālandscape. Brent, the global oil benchmark, averaged about $90 a barrel between 2022 and 2023. Now┬ĀitŌĆÖs trading below $75 a barrel, and futures for delivery in 2025 are changing hands at about $70 a barrel.┬Ā┬ĀItŌĆÖs not just the price of crude. Over the last three years, the industry┬Āalso profited from historically high refining margins (an average of $35 a barrel in 2022-23, compared with less than $15 now) and liquefied natural gas prices (an average of $24 per million British thermal unit in 2022-23, compared with┬Āabout $12 per million┬Ānow). The cyclical change wonŌĆÖt hit everyone equally, though. Exxon and Chevron are fitter than anyone. With little net debt and the highest credit ratings of all major oil companies, they could borrow to keep paying┬Āshareholders. A few quarters of debt-taking wonŌĆÖt push either company into trouble┬Ābut instead bring their leverage ratio to historical levels.┬ĀBoth companies anticipate significant year-over-year oil and gas production for 2025, giving them extra firepower. It could be a golden opportunity for Chevron and Exxon to showcase their stronger business model compared with their European rivals. Shell┬Āand TotalEnergies are, in that order, in the middle of the group┬ĀŌĆö┬Āand could weather a few bad quarters, even if they carry more debt than their American rivals. BP Plc faces the biggest risk┬Āand also has the weakest balance sheet. The British company, however, has already promised investors it wonŌĆÖt reduce the buyback rate until the end of 2025. ThatŌĆÖs rather courageous. Even those companies that┬Ācan take on debt to sustain elevated buybacks should opt for prudence. OPEC+ŌĆÖs plans for 2025 are unclear. The cartel has launched two price wars during the last decade, thus it would be wise to anticipate and plan for a third.┬ĀWeakening the balance sheet too much to sustain share repurchases would be a mistake until the cartel's plans become clearer, something unlikely before December. For now, Big Oil is putting on a┬Ābrave face. Between the lines, however,┬Āthe first warnings are emerging. Total, for example,┬Ātweaked┬Āits guidance for buybacks during the summer. In the past, the company said it would buy $2 billion a quarter; in August, it told investors it would buy ŌĆ£up toŌĆØ $2 billion a quarter. It may be the slimmest change, but directionally┬Āit matters. BP, for its part, warned investors that its 2025 outlook of $46 billion to $49 billion of underlying profits was based on energy prices staying at 2023 levels, when Brent averaged about $82 a barrel. If oil prices fell next year to an average of $75, the companyŌĆÖs┬Āown rule-of-thumb suggested a $4 billion shortfall. Currently, Brent for delivery next year is trading closer to $70┬Āa barrel. While buybacks need to come down,┬ĀI donŌĆÖt see a risk for dividends. ThatŌĆÖs┬Āin part┬Āthanks to the hefty buybacks of the last two years, which have reduced the number of shares outstanding┬Āand thus the overall cost of the dividend itself. It also helps that Shell┬Ācut its dividend during the pandemic for the first time since 1945, in turn improving the affordability of the payout. Of the five major international oil companies, only Exxon, Chevron and TotalEnergies havenŌĆÖt cut their dividends in several decades. Lower buybacks arenŌĆÖt catastrophic┬Ābut just a natural outcome┬Āas the cycle turns. If anything, perhaps the current rate of repurchases couldnŌĆÖt hold up to begin with. For example, Total and Shell, which promised to return as high as 40% of their free cash flow to investors, had at times paid close to 45%┬Āvia dividends and buybacks. That was unsustainable.

The period between 1977 and 1980 is one of the most interesting phases for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). During this time, its ideological mentee, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), had merged with the Janata Party, which had unseated the Indira Gandhi-led Congress government. This era saw the RSS navigating its relationship with the Janata Party, which comprised leaders from various political ideologies. The way the RSS managed this complex situation, as well as its regrouping after a 19-month brutal ban aimed at dismantling the organisation, offers valuable insights into its unique functioning and its approach to politics, politicians, and political parties. On March 21, 1977, the ban on the RSS was lifted, and the third RSS Sarsanghchalak, Balasaheb Deoras, was released from jail. As soon as he was freed, Balasaheb resumed his nationwide tour. Despite being hounded by the Indira government; his message was clear: there should be no vindictiveness. ŌĆ£The credit for the victory has been given to the RSS. It is time for us to be large-hearted. We need to bring change in the hearts of those who did not treat us well,ŌĆØ Balasaheb said while addressing a mammoth gathering in Nagpur in March 1977. On April 9, 1977, a huge welcome procession comprising thousands of swayamsevaks took Balasaheb from the New Delhi Railway station to a stage set up nearby. Several top leaders including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Nanaji Deshmukh, Dattopant Thengadi, Madhavrao Muley and Madhu Dandvate spoke from the same platform welcoming Balasaheb. Dandvate, a leading socialist leader, had spent considerable time with Balasaheb in Yerwada jail and that led to his change in views about the RSS. Balasaheb also interacted with journalists on the same day during his visit and clearly said that it was time to do away with bitterness and all should come together to strengthen the democracy. He also met the newly elected Prime Minister Morarji Desai and discussed the RSSŌĆÖ ideology of ŌĆśHindutvaŌĆÖ, explaining to him that it is an all-inclusive ideology and believes in taking everyone along. Next day, he was felicitated at a public function. Dharam Vira, a widely respected public figure and former Governor of West Bengal, Punjab, Haryana and Karnataka presided over it. The latter had also worked as Cabinet Secretary from 1964 to 1966 when Congress Party was ruling at the Centre. Earlier, Dharam Vira had worked as Principal Private Secretary to IndiaŌĆÖs first Prime Minister, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Balasaheb spoke at length on this occasion to expose how the Indira Gandhi government conspired to malign RSS. Balasaheb also revealed on this occasion that the authorities had raided all the RSS offices across the country during the emergency but couldnŌĆÖt find even a shred of incriminating material. He spoke at length in this function about the reasons for imposing a ban on the RSS by the Indira government. It was primarily because the RSSŌĆÖ swayamsevaks were participating very actively in the JP movement, he informed the audience. During his stay in Delhi, the issue of ŌĆśMuslims in RSSŌĆÖ was also raised by some journalists. Prominent Muslim leaders including Shahi Imam also came and met Balasaheb during those days. In the following months, the issue of the ŌĆśMuslims in RSSŌĆÖ was also discussed within the RSS. Balasaheb encouraged entry of Muslims in the organisation. He felt that it would help to ensure that they remain in the mainstream. At BalasahebŌĆÖs felicitation function in Mumbai, Justice (retd.) M.C. Chagla, noted jurist, diplomat and former Cabinet minister, known for his love for civil liberties, said, ŌĆ£I am a Muslim by religion and Hindu by nationality.ŌĆØ Noted legal luminary Nani Palkhivala also attended this function. In almost every public function that was attended by Balasaheb during those days, Muslim leaders keenly shared the stage with him. Even as the RSS was initiating a process at social level for various stakeholders to come together to ride over the strife and chasm created during the emergency period so that the country could move towards attaining higher goals, the situation deteriorated fast in the political arena. The ruling Janata party at the Centre started falling apart. Several leaders of the party were at loggerheads. Many of them approached Balasaheb also who suggested to all of them that they should work together towards nation-building, but there were too many ego clashes. Madhu Limye, a socialist leader, started instigating several of his colleagues to raise the issue of ŌĆśdual membershipŌĆÖ within the party. The move was to check the rising influence of BJS leaders who had merged their party with Janata Party but retained their close ties with the RSS. Those who were supporting the move by Madhu Limye demanded that either the BJS leaders should remain in the Janata Party or in RSS. They cannot have membership of both. The move was malicious as RSS was a non-political organisation and had no system of formal membership. This controversy erupted in August 1977, within six months of the Janata Party being sworn in. It was well known that Limye was quite upset about not being made the minister. So, it appears that he decided to wreck the boat. Balasaheb took the principled stand that the decision regarding association with the RSS has to be taken by the leaders of BJS. As far as Sangh was concerned, it would not break its relationship with anyone under any pressure. Limye also raised the question about the presence of many central ministers to welcome Balasaheb in Delhi. The then Prime Minister Morarji Desai told his ministers that he would not like them to go in such programmes. Sikander Bakht, a member of the Morarji cabinet and Lok Sabha member from Chandni Chowk in Delhi told Morarji that he didnŌĆÖt feel there was anything wrong in ministers going to welcome Balasaheb. Bakht himself was amongst those who had gone to attend the programme which was at the origin of this unnecessary controversy. The bickering not only continued but rather intensified. Meanwhile, unperturbed by all these controversies, Balasaheb decided to expand the organisational network in areas where the RSS hadnŌĆÖt reached yet. He adopted a three-phased strategy. In the first phase, the RSS focused on activating those members who had been lying dormant for some years. In the second phase, the organisation started connecting with socially marginalised sections of the society. In the third phase, efforts were made to connect with Muslims. The overall objective was to send a message in the society that RSS considers work done by all those who are working for the good of the society as its own work. The Janata Party government collapsed in 1980 and Indira Gandhi made a comeback at the Centre. The erstwhile members of the BJS formed a new political outfit Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980. The RSS remained unperturbed by these political developments and continued to focus on its organisational work giving a major thrust to expand its outreach amongst all sections of society.

(PTI Photo).Related stories.,"Union Home Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Shah on Monday assured alliance partners Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) of a fair share of seats to contest in the Maharashtra Assembly elections scheduled to be held later this year. In a meeting with Chief Minister Eknath Shinde (SS) and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar (NCP) at the Mumbai airport, Shah sought to address the issue of a growing rift among the alliance partners which spilled over into the public and advised them to focus on strengthening the governmentâ€™s position instead of fretting over the number of seats each party would contest in the Assembly polls. As per BJP sources, the party is likely to contest around 150 of the 288 seats as part of the Mahayuti alliance while the Shiv Sena is likely to get 75 to 80 seats, and the NCP, 55-60, reports The Indian Express. Notably, Sena and NCP have demanded 85-90 and 60 seats, respectively, for the Maharashtra Assembly elections. Shah, who arrived in Mumbai on a short visit on Saturday, also held a meeting with senior BJP leaders and directed them to pull up their socks for the coming elections and set them a target of winning 125 seats of the 150-odd it plans to contest. During the meeting of the BJPâ€™s core committee, Shah also held one-on-one talks with the leaders and pointed out the shortcomings in their respective districts. Shah also briefed leaders on taking the Mahayuti governmentâ€™s schemes to the people besides keeping critical factors like farmers unrest, Dalit sentiments and Marathas versus OBC tension in mind during campaigning. This is the first time that Shah has assured leaders of the Mahayuti alliances of a good number of seats in Maharashtra. The accommodative approach adopted by the BJP leadership is likely to have stemmed from the debacle the alliance faced in the Lok Sabha elections held earlier this year. The BJP won nine of the 28 seats it contested while with the Shiv Sena bagged seven of 15 seats and the NCP one of 3. The combined tally of the NDA stood at an unimpressive 17 of 48 seats while the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance won 30 seats. In the 2019 Maharashtra elections, the BJP, in alliance with the undivided Shiv Sena, contested 164 out of 288 seats, while the Shiv Sena contested 126 seats. The undivided NCP, on the other hand, contested 121 seats in the 2019 polls. The Lok Sabha election results and the formation of the government had triggered unease within the Mahayuti over the allocation of portfolios following its reduced tally in the state. Moreover, the RSS' critique of the BJP's decision to ally with Pawar's NCP, and Ajit Pawar's conciliatory tone regarding Sharad Pawar alsoÂ led to speculation that the party may be on its way out of the alliance. The acrimony had gradually started to become visible to the public with statements by senior leaders of the Shiv Sena and the NCPÂ taking on each other. ",2024-09-10 12:31,2024-09-10,12:31

Â â€śâ€¦I can see here in the crowd, people from Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala. I have been a Member of Parliament for Kerala. First, when you say, when you don't understand, Kerala is a simple word, Punjab is a simple word, but these are not simple words. This is your history, your language, your tradition. Your entire imagination is in these words,â€ť the Congress leader. BJP reacts Reacting to Gandhiâ€™s remarks, the BJP challenged the Congress leader to repeat in India what he said about the Sikhs in Virginia and said that then they will file a case against the LoP and drag him to the court. BJP leader RP Singh said that 3,000 Sikhs were massacred in Delhi during the Congress regime. ""3000 Sikhs were massacred in Delhi; their turbans were taken off, their hair was chopped off and beard was shaved...He (Rahul Gandhi) doesn't say that this happened when they (Congress) were in power...I challenge Rahul Gandhi to repeat in India what he is saying about Sikhs, and then I will file a case against him and will drag him to court,"" Singh said. Union Minister Shivraj Singh said Â when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Leader of Opposition, he never tried to malign the image of the country. ""Rahul Gandhi is the LoP and the position of LoP is a responsible position. I want to remind Rahul Gandhi that when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the LoP, in a foreign land, he never tried to malign the image of the country...Due to being defeated consecutively for the third time, anti-BJP, anti-RSS and anti-Modi sentiments have taken root in his mind...He is constantly trying to malign the image of the country. Maligning the image of the country is equivalent to treason...Who attacked the Constitution? Who imposed the emergency? He goes on a Bharat Jodo Yatra but he is unable to unite neither with India nor with the people of India,"" Chouhan said. (With inputs from agencies)  ",2024-09-10 11:44,2024-09-10,11:44

The father of the modern oil industry had a name for it: a ŌĆ£good sweating.ŌĆØ A century later, OPEC+ is giving Big Oil the modern equivalent of RockefellerŌĆÖs time-tested tactics. Not everyone will be fit enough for it. For the last two-and-a-half years, Big Oil has enjoyed a bonanza, profiting from the impact of RussiaŌĆÖs invasion of Ukraine and OPEC+ŌĆÖs tight control of the market. High prices inflated cash generation, leading to bumper payouts to shareholders ŌĆö┬Āvia, above all, buybacks. But the tailwind has now turned into a headwind, and the size of the groupŌĆÖs share repurchases will drop, probably from 2025 onward. Jefferies Financial Group Inc, an investment bank, has warned that at current forward prices for next year, half of the international oil companies ŌĆ£canŌĆÖt sustain their distributionŌĆØ without taking more debt. For Big Oil, thatŌĆÖs a big problem. The industry┬ĀdoesnŌĆÖt have many allies on┬ĀWall Street┬Āand certainly even fewer in the greener financial hubs of Europe. In the climate-crisis era, Fossil Fuel Inc needs to shower shareholders with money just to keep investors ŌĆö particularly the large generalists ŌĆö onside.  The size of the buybacks has been huge. Only this quarter, ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Shell Plc, TotalEnergies SE┬Āand BP Plc┬Āplan to repurchase more than $16.5 billion┬Āof shares. On an annualised basis, thatŌĆÖs equal to $66 billion a year, or about 5.5% of Big OilŌĆÖs current combined market value. The mega buybacks made sense during the boom. But Big Oil now faces┬Āa completely different┬Ālandscape. Brent, the global oil benchmark, averaged about $90 a barrel between 2022 and 2023. Now┬ĀitŌĆÖs trading below $75 a barrel, and futures for delivery in 2025 are changing hands at about $70 a barrel.┬Ā┬ĀItŌĆÖs not just the price of crude. Over the last three years, the industry┬Āalso profited from historically high refining margins (an average of $35 a barrel in 2022-23, compared with less than $15 now) and liquefied natural gas prices (an average of $24 per million British thermal unit in 2022-23, compared with┬Āabout $12 per million┬Ānow). The cyclical change wonŌĆÖt hit everyone equally, though. Exxon and Chevron are fitter than anyone. With little net debt and the highest credit ratings of all major oil companies, they could borrow to keep paying┬Āshareholders. A few quarters of debt-taking wonŌĆÖt push either company into trouble┬Ābut instead bring their leverage ratio to historical levels.┬ĀBoth companies anticipate significant year-over-year oil and gas production for 2025, giving them extra firepower. It could be a golden opportunity for Chevron and Exxon to showcase their stronger business model compared with their European rivals. Shell┬Āand TotalEnergies are, in that order, in the middle of the group┬ĀŌĆö┬Āand could weather a few bad quarters, even if they carry more debt than their American rivals. BP Plc faces the biggest risk┬Āand also has the weakest balance sheet. The British company, however, has already promised investors it wonŌĆÖt reduce the buyback rate until the end of 2025. ThatŌĆÖs rather courageous. Even those companies that┬Ācan take on debt to sustain elevated buybacks should opt for prudence. OPEC+ŌĆÖs plans for 2025 are unclear. The cartel has launched two price wars during the last decade, thus it would be wise to anticipate and plan for a third.┬ĀWeakening the balance sheet too much to sustain share repurchases would be a mistake until the cartel's plans become clearer, something unlikely before December. For now, Big Oil is putting on a┬Ābrave face. Between the lines, however,┬Āthe first warnings are emerging. Total, for example,┬Ātweaked┬Āits guidance for buybacks during the summer. In the past, the company said it would buy $2 billion a quarter; in August, it told investors it would buy ŌĆ£up toŌĆØ $2 billion a quarter. It may be the slimmest change, but directionally┬Āit matters. BP, for its part, warned investors that its 2025 outlook of $46 billion to $49 billion of underlying profits was based on energy prices staying at 2023 levels, when Brent averaged about $82 a barrel. If oil prices fell next year to an average of $75, the companyŌĆÖs┬Āown rule-of-thumb suggested a $4 billion shortfall. Currently, Brent for delivery next year is trading closer to $70┬Āa barrel. While buybacks need to come down,┬ĀI donŌĆÖt see a risk for dividends. ThatŌĆÖs┬Āin part┬Āthanks to the hefty buybacks of the last two years, which have reduced the number of shares outstanding┬Āand thus the overall cost of the dividend itself. It also helps that Shell┬Ācut its dividend during the pandemic for the first time since 1945, in turn improving the affordability of the payout. Of the five major international oil companies, only Exxon, Chevron and TotalEnergies havenŌĆÖt cut their dividends in several decades. Lower buybacks arenŌĆÖt catastrophic┬Ābut just a natural outcome┬Āas the cycle turns. If anything, perhaps the current rate of repurchases couldnŌĆÖt hold up to begin with. For example, Total and Shell, which promised to return as high as 40% of their free cash flow to investors, had at times paid close to 45%┬Āvia dividends and buybacks. That was unsustainable.

The growth could propel Apple to capture an 8 percent market share in terms of volume, with an average selling price nearly three times higher than the market average, they said. This would solidify Apple's position as a dominant player in the premium smartphone segment. â€śThe new iPhone 16 series is set to accelerate Apple's growth momentum in India further, capitalising on its strong aspirational appeal among Indian consumers,â€ť Prabhu Ram, head of industry intelligence group CyberMedia Research (CMR) said. â€śMore buyers are prioritising the latest iPhone models, reversing the historical trend of opting for older generations.â€ť Earlier in the day, the Cupertino-based tech giant unveiled iPhone 16, the companyâ€™s first phone designed around artificial intelligence. Apple is peaking at the right time in India, significantly when the premiumisation trend is rising, analysts said. In India, almost 17 percent of smartphone volumes and 45 percent of value came from the Rs 30,000 and above price segment alone. The iPhone 16 Pro's more strategic and accessible pricing compared to its predecessor, coupled with the premiumisation trend, is expected to drive upgrades in the Indian market, making it more appealing to a wider range of consumers, Ram said. Stronger adoption expected The iPhone 16 series is expected to grow 30 percent year on year compared to the iPhone 15 in the launch quarter in India, a CMR analysis said. The growth trajectory positions Apple to garner up to 8 percent of the hypercompetitive Indian smartphone market by the end of 2024, Ram said. India remains a crucial to Appleâ€™s growth over the next decade. IDC, too, expects Appleâ€™s smartphone volume share to reach 8 percent in 2024. â€śWe expect them to ship around 12.5-13 million iPhones in 2024. They are set to reach 8%+ volume market share in India with almost three times the market ASP and help it cement its position in the premium end of the market,â€ť Navkendar Singh, associate vice president, IDC India, told Moneycontrol. â€śIn the coming months of festive buying in India, iPhone 14 and 15 models will do very well with price drops and affordability offers.â€ť Singh said iPhone 16 models would certainly invoke much interest from consumers looking to move up from 12, 13 and 14 models with its Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence will also give iPhones a much-needed feature to match AI in the Samsung Galaxy line-up. GenAI: A game-changer? Even though iPhone 16 features are incremental over the previous ones, consumers will likely consider buying the latest model, especially those who want to be GenAI-ready. The GenAI rollout will be staggered. â€śWith iPhone 16, we expect a record number of upgrades mix this year for Apple in India. However, the bulk of the iPhone growth in India will still come from first-time iPhone users,â€ť said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint.Â  â€śAppleâ€™s growth in India since 2019 ensures that whenever a new iPhone launches, there is a healthy mix of upgrades for any new launch.â€ť Pathak added that subtle design changes and software support from Apple mean older generation devices remain relevant for a longer period and help consumers to switch to the Apple ecosystem at a lower cost, especially in a price-conscious country like India. Strong Apple iPhone sales and other hardware categories such as MacBooks and iPads will drive its revenues by 18 percent year-on-year in 2024. The double-digit growth will continue in 2025, Pathak said. â€śWhile the iPhone remains the major driver, with revenues expected to cross the $10-billion mark in 2025, there would be growth in all other hardware categories. Revenues from Mac, iPad, Watch, AirPods, and even services are also expected to grow rapidly as consumers in India adopt the wider ecosystem of Apple products,â€ť he added. Analysts note that Apple continues to enjoy strong demand and has recently expanded its channel presence in India, fuelling growth. Apple remains highly desirable as an aspirational brand focused solely on the premium segment. The primary barrier for consumers has been affordability but this has been addressed through financing schemes, making iPhones accessible to a broader section of the population. The iPhone 16 series has been launched in India with the price of the base models unchanged from the iPhone 15. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus start at Rs 79,900 and Rs 89,900. The big drop has been in the price of Pro models â€” iPhone 16 Pro and the Pro Max start at Rs 1,19,900 and Rs 1,49,900, Rs 15,000 cheaper than the 15 models. The reduced price is primarily on account of a cut in custom duty on CBU phones and in anticipation of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max series being manufactured in India later this year. The iPhone 16 series, including the Pro models, is being manufactured in India and will be available worldwide within a few days of its release,Moneycontrol reported on July 26.Â This marks a significant milestone for India's manufacturing sector as it is the first time that a product made in India will be distributed globally so soon after its launch. Cheaper iPhone16 Pro a Challenge for Samsung? Apple has planned better for iPhone 16 Pro models than their predecessors. This, coupled with the premiumisation trend, will drive upgrades in the Rs 1 lakh plus price segment, making it more appealing to a wider range of consumers. ""The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models are expected to continue to account for the majority of sales, about 75 percent. However, due to the reduced pricing of the Pro and Pro Max models, their contribution is expected to be almost 2/5th of iPhone sales in India,"" Singh said. Cheaper 16 Pro models will help Apple further push sales in the Rs 1 lakh and above segment, Pathak said. Faisal Kawoosa, analyst at TechArc, said Apple is gaining share in the â€śluxe segmentâ€ť (above Rs 50,000) segment, making it challenging for Samsung despite having a foldable form factor and Google, which is trying to find its feet in the market. Shipment of smartphones priced Rs 1 lakh and above increased 20 percent and 10 percent YoY for Q1 2024 and Q2 2024, Counterpoint research has said. Shipments in the segment accounted for just over a percent of the market in H1 2024. The share is expected to increase slightly in the second half of the year, Pathak said. In the first half of 2024, the number of smartphones priced at Rs 1 lakh and above increased by 81 percent year over year, CMR said. ",2024-09-10 12:58,2024-09-10,12:58

The cyclical change wonŌĆÖt hit everyone equally, though. Exxon and Chevron are fitter than anyone. With little net debt and the highest credit ratings of all major oil companies, they could borrow to keep paying┬Āshareholders. A few quarters of debt-taking wonŌĆÖt push either company into trouble┬Ābut instead bring their leverage ratio to historical levels.┬ĀBoth companies anticipate significant year-over-year oil and gas production for 2025, giving them extra firepower. It could be a golden opportunity for Chevron and Exxon to showcase their stronger business model compared with their European rivals. Shell┬Āand TotalEnergies are, in that order, in the middle of the group┬ĀŌĆö┬Āand could weather a few bad quarters, even if they carry more debt than their American rivals. BP Plc faces the biggest risk┬Āand also has the weakest balance sheet. The British company, however, has already promised investors it wonŌĆÖt reduce the buyback rate until the end of 2025. ThatŌĆÖs rather courageous. Even those companies that┬Ācan take on debt to sustain elevated buybacks should opt for prudence. OPEC+ŌĆÖs plans for 2025 are unclear. The cartel has launched two price wars during the last decade, thus it would be wise to anticipate and plan for a third.┬ĀWeakening the balance sheet too much to sustain share repurchases would be a mistake until the cartel's plans become clearer, something unlikely before December. For now, Big Oil is putting on a┬Ābrave face. Between the lines, however,┬Āthe first warnings are emerging. Total, for example,┬Ātweaked┬Āits guidance for buybacks during the summer. In the past, the company said it would buy $2 billion a quarter; in August, it told investors it would buy ŌĆ£up toŌĆØ $2 billion a quarter. It may be the slimmest change, but directionally┬Āit matters. BP, for its part, warned investors that its 2025 outlook of $46 billion to $49 billion of underlying profits was based on energy prices staying at 2023 levels, when Brent averaged about $82 a barrel. If oil prices fell next year to an average of $75, the companyŌĆÖs┬Āown rule-of-thumb suggested a $4 billion shortfall. Currently, Brent for delivery next year is trading closer to $70┬Āa barrel. While buybacks need to come down,┬ĀI donŌĆÖt see a risk for dividends. ThatŌĆÖs┬Āin part┬Āthanks to the hefty buybacks of the last two years, which have reduced the number of shares outstanding┬Āand thus the overall cost of the dividend itself. It also helps that Shell┬Ācut its dividend during the pandemic for the first time since 1945, in turn improving the affordability of the payout. Of the five major international oil companies, only Exxon, Chevron and TotalEnergies havenŌĆÖt cut their dividends in several decades. Lower buybacks arenŌĆÖt catastrophic┬Ābut just a natural outcome┬Āas the cycle turns. If anything, perhaps the current rate of repurchases couldnŌĆÖt hold up to begin with. For example, Total and Shell, which promised to return as high as 40% of their free cash flow to investors, had at times paid close to 45%┬Āvia dividends and buybacks. That was unsustainable.

The growth could propel Apple to capture an 8 percent market share in terms of volume, with an average selling price nearly three times higher than the market average, they said. This would solidify Apple's position as a dominant player in the premium smartphone segment. â€śThe new iPhone 16 series is set to accelerate Apple's growth momentum in India further, capitalising on its strong aspirational appeal among Indian consumers,â€ť Prabhu Ram, head of industry intelligence group CyberMedia Research (CMR) said. â€śMore buyers are prioritising the latest iPhone models, reversing the historical trend of opting for older generations.â€ť Earlier in the day, the Cupertino-based tech giant unveiled iPhone 16, the companyâ€™s first phone designed around artificial intelligence. Apple is peaking at the right time in India, significantly when the premiumisation trend is rising, analysts said. In India, almost 17 percent of smartphone volumes and 45 percent of value came from the Rs 30,000 and above price segment alone. The iPhone 16 Pro's more strategic and accessible pricing compared to its predecessor, coupled with the premiumisation trend, is expected to drive upgrades in the Indian market, making it more appealing to a wider range of consumers, Ram said. Stronger adoption expected The iPhone 16 series is expected to grow 30 percent year on year compared to the iPhone 15 in the launch quarter in India, a CMR analysis said. The growth trajectory positions Apple to garner up to 8 percent of the hypercompetitive Indian smartphone market by the end of 2024, Ram said. India remains a crucial to Appleâ€™s growth over the next decade. IDC, too, expects Appleâ€™s smartphone volume share to reach 8 percent in 2024. â€śWe expect them to ship around 12.5-13 million iPhones in 2024. They are set to reach 8%+ volume market share in India with almost three times the market ASP and help it cement its position in the premium end of the market,â€ť Navkendar Singh, associate vice president, IDC India, told Moneycontrol. â€śIn the coming months of festive buying in India, iPhone 14 and 15 models will do very well with price drops and affordability offers.â€ť Singh said iPhone 16 models would certainly invoke much interest from consumers looking to move up from 12, 13 and 14 models with its Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence will also give iPhones a much-needed feature to match AI in the Samsung Galaxy line-up. GenAI: A game-changer? Even though iPhone 16 features are incremental over the previous ones, consumers will likely consider buying the latest model, especially those who want to be GenAI-ready. The GenAI rollout will be staggered. â€śWith iPhone 16, we expect a record number of upgrades mix this year for Apple in India. However, the bulk of the iPhone growth in India will still come from first-time iPhone users,â€ť said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint.Â  â€śAppleâ€™s growth in India since 2019 ensures that whenever a new iPhone launches, there is a healthy mix of upgrades for any new launch.â€ť Pathak added that subtle design changes and software support from Apple mean older generation devices remain relevant for a longer period and help consumers to switch to the Apple ecosystem at a lower cost, especially in a price-conscious country like India. Strong Apple iPhone sales and other hardware categories such as MacBooks and iPads will drive its revenues by 18 percent year-on-year in 2024. The double-digit growth will continue in 2025, Pathak said. â€śWhile the iPhone remains the major driver, with revenues expected to cross the $10-billion mark in 2025, there would be growth in all other hardware categories. Revenues from Mac, iPad, Watch, AirPods, and even services are also expected to grow rapidly as consumers in India adopt the wider ecosystem of Apple products,â€ť he added. Analysts note that Apple continues to enjoy strong demand and has recently expanded its channel presence in India, fuelling growth. Apple remains highly desirable as an aspirational brand focused solely on the premium segment. The primary barrier for consumers has been affordability but this has been addressed through financing schemes, making iPhones accessible to a broader section of the population. The iPhone 16 series has been launched in India with the price of the base models unchanged from the iPhone 15. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus start at Rs 79,900 and Rs 89,900. The big drop has been in the price of Pro models â€” iPhone 16 Pro and the Pro Max start at Rs 1,19,900 and Rs 1,49,900, Rs 15,000 cheaper than the 15 models. The reduced price is primarily on account of a cut in custom duty on CBU phones and in anticipation of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max series being manufactured in India later this year. The iPhone 16 series, including the Pro models, is being manufactured in India and will be available worldwide within a few days of its release,Moneycontrol reported on July 26.Â This marks a significant milestone for India's manufacturing sector as it is the first time that a product made in India will be distributed globally so soon after its launch. Cheaper iPhone16 Pro a Challenge for Samsung? Apple has planned better for iPhone 16 Pro models than their predecessors. This, coupled with the premiumisation trend, will drive upgrades in the Rs 1 lakh plus price segment, making it more appealing to a wider range of consumers. ""The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models are expected to continue to account for the majority of sales, about 75 percent. However, due to the reduced pricing of the Pro and Pro Max models, their contribution is expected to be almost 2/5th of iPhone sales in India,"" Singh said. Cheaper 16 Pro models will help Apple further push sales in the Rs 1 lakh and above segment, Pathak said. Faisal Kawoosa, analyst at TechArc, said Apple is gaining share in the â€śluxe segmentâ€ť (above Rs 50,000) segment, making it challenging for Samsung despite having a foldable form factor and Google, which is trying to find its feet in the market. Shipment of smartphones priced Rs 1 lakh and above increased 20 percent and 10 percent YoY for Q1 2024 and Q2 2024, Counterpoint research has said. Shipments in the segment accounted for just over a percent of the market in H1 2024. The share is expected to increase slightly in the second half of the year, Pathak said. In the first half of 2024, the number of smartphones priced at Rs 1 lakh and above increased by 81 percent year over year, CMR said. ",2024-09-10 12:58,2024-09-10,12:58

""India has 3 crore end-of-life vehicles, but the country does not have enough scrapping centres to process these vehicles,"" Gadkari said at the 64th Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) Annual Convention. He added that at the moment India has 63 operational vehicle scrapping centres, with 60 more under construction and an additional 40 in planning stage. The country has 78 operationalÂ automated fitness test centres, while 179 more are being built and 83 planned. Gadkari has in the past said that the country needs 1,000 vehicle scrapping centres and 400 automated fitness test centres. Noting that the National Vehicle Scrappage Policy is a win-win for all stakeholders, the minister said that India can be a scrapping hub in South Asia as it will help automobile companies reduce their raw material costs and will help India reduce the import of steel. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the National Vehicle Scrappage Policy in August 2021 and said it would help phase out unfit and polluting vehicles and also promote a circular economy. Under the new policy, the Centre had said the states and Union Territories (UTs) will provide up to 25 percent rebate on road tax for vehicles that are purchased after scrapping old vehicles. The vehicle scrappage policy has come into effect from April 1, 2022. Announced in theUnion Budget2021-22, the policy provides for fitness tests after 20 years for personal vehicles, while commercial vehicles will require it after the completion of 15 years. The road minister also announced that the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) is planning to invest around Rs 500 crore over a four-to-five-year period, as it looks to improve the testing infrastructure. This investment by Indiaâ€™s vehicle testing and certification agency will go towards setting up testing infrastructure for hydrogen-internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and construction equipment, besidesÂ  additional safety technologies. The Pune-based agency has testing capabilities for ethanol 20-compliant vehicles.

Data from proptech firm NoBroker shows thattenantsin key cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Delhi-NCR would typically move around nine times before purchasing a home. That was the trend a decade back. Today, younger generations are opting to buy after renting only 4-5 times. Abhishek Sinha makes a classic example of the evolving trend.Â The 32-year-old employee in a medical startup recently purchased a home in Bengaluruâ€™s Whitefield for Rs 1.9 crore after changing three apartments he took on rent. The story of Akshay Punjabi too shows the evolving trend. By the time he turned 32, the retail e-commerce employee hadÂ invested over Rs 1 crore in a prime residential project by Sumadhura Group in Whitefield. ""Given the high rental yield we see in Bengaluru, with Rs 60,000-80,000 rental return per month, I decided to invest in a prime residential project in the eastern IT corridor,"" he said. ""Given the high rentals in Bengaluru and also the home loan interest rates, I felt buying my own apartment will be a more stable financial decision than renting one. This also gives me the option to capitalise on my investments in future, when the prices will appreciate by the time I turn 40,"" said Akshay. In the first half of 2024, millennials and Gen Z accounted for over 60 percent of property purchases on NoBrokerâ€™s platform in Bengaluru. Saurabh Garg, co-founder of NoBroker, noted that Gen Z alone made up 16 percent of these transactions, while millennials represented the rest. Gen Z refers to individuals aged 11-26, while millennials fall in the 27-42-year bracket. Prime areas in Bengaluru have seen rent surging 45-50 percent over the past three years. A two-bedroom apartment in a desirable location now commands Rs 50,000-65,000 a month in rent, while that for a three-bedroom unit reaches Rs 80,000. â€śWeâ€™ve closed several deals between Rs 1-2 crore, withbuyersin the 28-40 age range. We recently sold apartments in Bellandur and Indiranagar for over Rs 1 crore each, where the tenants preferred buying, instead of paying hefty rents,â€ť said Sunil Singh, director at Realty Corp. Rising Income Fuels Housing Demand A boost in income levels has further fuelled the trend of buying homes. According to the Karnataka Economic Survey 2023-24, per-capita income in the state has grown 5.8 percent between 2022 and 2023.Â Salaries in Bengaluru have seen a significant uptick after the pandemic. â€śThis salary growth has been a key factor driving housing demand among millennials and Gen Z in the city. In FY25, half of the 42 sale transactions we facilitated were from this demographic zone. Many are saving up for the 20 percent down payment required for these deals,â€ť said Kiran Kumar from Hanu Reddy Realty. Lucrative Rental Yields Attract Investors Attractiverentalyields too have been drawingÂ young homebuyers into the market. Rental returns in Bengaluru have climbed to 4-5 percent in the eastern IT corridor of Whitefield, with pockets of Indiranagar and Koramangala offering over 5 percent. â€śThe majority of young buyers are looking for ready-to-move-in properties or are willing to wait for new inventory less than six months old. In Bengaluru, many prefer to invest under Rs 1 crore in 1BHK units for their rental potential. For end-users, the sweet spot is between Rs 1 crore and Rs 1.5 crore in prime areas like Indiranagar, Koramangala, and Whitefield,â€ť Singh added. ",2024-09-10 12:35,2024-09-10,12:35
